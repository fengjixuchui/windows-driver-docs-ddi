# IOCTL_MOUNTDEV_LINK_CREATED IOCTL

## -description

Support for this IOCTL by the mount manager clients is optional. The mount manager uses this IOCTL to alert the client driver that a persistent name has been assigned to its volume. The input for this IOCTL is the persistent name assigned.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

The mount point manager places a variable-length structure of type [MOUNTDEV_NAME](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mountmgr/ns-mountmgr-_mountdev_name), defined in *Mountmgr.h* at the beginning of the buffer at **Irp-\>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer**. The mount manager inserts the persistent name just assigned at the address pointed to by the *Name* member of this structure.

### -input-buffer-length

**Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength** in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to **sizeof**(MOUNTDEV_NAME).

### -output-buffer

None

### -output-buffer-length

None

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

## -remarks

The implementer of this function must not thread synchronize and must not make blocking and/or Interprocess Communication (IPC) function calls.

### -status-block

No status.
