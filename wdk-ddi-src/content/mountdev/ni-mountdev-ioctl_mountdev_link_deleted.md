# IOCTL_MOUNTDEV_LINK_DELETED IOCTL


## -description

Support for this IOCTL by the mount manager clients is optional. It alerts the mount manager client that a persistent name associated with it has been deleted. The input for this IOCTL is the persistent name that was deleted.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

The mount point manager places a variable-length structure of type [MOUNTDEV_NAME](../mountmgr/ns-mountmgr-_mountdev_name.md), defined in *Mountmgr.h*, at the beginning of the buffer at **Irp-\>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer**. The mount manager inserts the persistent name just assigned at the address pointed to by the *Name* member of this structure.

### -input-buffer-length

**Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength** in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to **sizeof**(MOUNTDEV_NAME).

### -output-buffer

None

### -output-buffer-length

None

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

No status.

## -remarks

The implementer of this function must not thread synchronize and must not make blocking and/or Interprocess Communication (IPC) function calls.
