# IOCTL_INTERNAL_SELECT_DEVICE IOCTL


##  Major Code:


[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control)

## -description



The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_SELECT_DEVICE</b> request:

<ul>
<li>
Allocates the parallel port

The system-supplied function driver for parallel ports allocates the parallel port if the client does not set the PAR_HAVE_PORT_KEEP_PORT flag in the <b>CommandFlags</b> member of the input PARALLEL_1284_COMMAND structure. Otherwise, the parallel port function driver does not allocate the parallel port.

</li>
<li>
Selects an IEEE 1284.3 daisy chain parallel device or an end-of-chain device attached to the parallel port

Although a client can select an end-of-chain device using a select device request, Microsoft recommends using an <a href="..\parallel\ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_parallel_port_allocate.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_PORT_ALLOCATE</a> request instead. The parallel port function driver selects the end-of-chain device before it allocates the parallel port to a client.

</li>
</ul>

## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> points to a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_1284_command.md">PARALLEL_1284_COMMAND</a> structure that the client allocates to input the select device information.


### -input-buffer-length

The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member specifies the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_1284_COMMAND structure.


### -output-buffer

None.


### -output-buffer-length

None.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

The <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by internal device control requests for parallel ports or to one of the following values:




#### -STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL

The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_1284_COMMAND structure.


#### -STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

The specified device is not flagged internally as an end-of-chain device and the value of the <b>ID</b> member of the input structure is greater than the number of existing daisy chain devices.
