# IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_CONNECT_INTERRUPT IOCTL


##  Major Code:


[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control)


## -description

The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_CONNECT_INTERRUPT</b> request connects an optional interrupt service routine and an optional <i>deferred port check</i> routine to a parallel port. Only kernel-mode drivers can use this request.

The connect interrupt request returns information that the driver can use in the context of a driver-specific ISR. The information includes a pointer to the interrupt object and pointers to callback routines that allocate and free the parallel port at IRQL = DIRQL.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    Microsoft does not recommend using a client-supplied interrupt routine. The use of interrupts might cause system instability. By default, the connect interrupt request is disabled. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/ff543934(v=vs.85)">Connecting an Interrupt Service Routine to a ParallelPort</a>.</div><div> </div>

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_interrupt_service_routine.md">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE</a> structure that the client allocates to input interrupt service information. The system-supplied function driver for parallel ports uses the same memory buffer, but casts it to a different data type to output information.

### -input-buffer-length

The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure.

### -output-buffer

The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION structure that the parallel port function driver uses to output parallel interrupt information.

### -output-buffer-length

The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_interrupt_information.md">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION</a> structure.

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

If the request is successful, the <b>Information</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_interrupt_information.md">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION</a> structure. Otherwise, the <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by internal device control requests for parallel ports or to one of the following values:




**STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL**

At least one of the following is true:

The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure.

The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OuputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION structure.
