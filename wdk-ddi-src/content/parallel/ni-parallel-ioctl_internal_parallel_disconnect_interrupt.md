# IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_DISCONNECT_INTERRUPT IOCTL


##  Major Code:


[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control)

## -description


The <b>IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_DISCONNECT_INTERRUPT</b> request disconnects an interrupt service routine (and an optional deferred port check service routine) that was connected by using an <a href="..\parallel\ni-parallel-ioctl_internal_parallel_connect_interrupt.md">IOCTL_INTERNAL_PARALLEL_CONNECT_INTERRUPT</a> request. Only kernel-mode drivers can connect and disconnect an interrupt routine.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    Microsoft does not recommend using a client-supplied interrupt routine. The use of interrupts might cause system instability. By default, the connect interrupt request is disabled. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff543934(v=vs.85)">Connecting an Interrupt Service Routine to a ParallelPort</a>.</div><div> </div>

## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a <a href="..\parallel\ns-parallel-_parallel_interrupt_service_routine.md">PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE</a> structure that the client allocates for the input of interrupt service information.


### -input-buffer-length

The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure.


### -output-buffer

None.


### -output-buffer-length

None.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

The <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by internal device control requests for parallel ports or to one of the following values:




#### -STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL

The value of the <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is less than the size, in bytes, of a PARALLEL_INTERRUPT_SERVICE_ROUTINE structure.


#### -STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

The specified interrupt service routine is not connected.
