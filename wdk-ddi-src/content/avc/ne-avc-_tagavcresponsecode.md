# _tagAvcResponseCode enumeration


## -description


The AvcResponseCode enumeration type is used to indicate the type of response received by a subunit driver from its AV/C subunit through <b>AVC_FUNCTION_COMMAND</b> or <b>AVC_FUNCTION_SEND_RESPONSE</b> function codes.


## -enum-fields




### -field AVC_RESPONSE_NOTIMPL

Indicates the subunit does not support the specified control command.


### -field AVC_RESPONSE_ACCEPTED

Indicates the subunit does implement the specified control command and that subunit state permits execution of the command. Note: Command execution may not have completed by the time the <b>AVC_RESPONSE_ACCEPTED</b> has been returned.


### -field AVC_RESPONSE_REJECTED

Specifies a response indicating the command or request was rejected.


### -field AVC_RESPONSE_IN_TRANSITION

Specifies a response indicating the command or request was accepted.


### -field AVC_RESPONSE_STABLE

Indicates the subunit implements the command. Same meaning as AVC_RESPONSE_IMPLMENTED.


### -field AVC_RESPONSE_IMPLEMENTED

Indicates the subunit implements the command. Same meaning as AVC_RESPONSE_STABLE.


### -field AVC_RESPONSE_CHANGED

Indicates the subunit state has changed.


### -field AVC_RESPONSE_INTERIM

Indicates the subunit is unable to respond with either <b>AVC_RESPONSE_ACCEPTED</b> or <b>AVC_RESPONSE_REJECTED</b> within the 100 millisecond timeframe for responses. The subunit will ultimately return a response frame with either a <b>AVC_RESPONSE_ACCEPTED</b> or <b>AVC_RESPONSE_REJECTED</b> code.
