### -param DiskByteOffset [in]

The value, in bytes, relative to the source partition for the crash dump or hibernation. Filter drivers should not modify this field.


### -param Mdl [in]

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl">MDL</a> structure that describes the data buffer containing the dump data. Filter drivers should not modify this field.
