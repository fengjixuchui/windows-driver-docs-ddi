# IAllocatorMXF interface


## -description


The <code>IAllocatorMXF</code> interface manages buffer storage for DirectMusic streams. The DMus port driver implements this interface and exposes it to the DMus miniport driver. The DMus port driver creates an <code>IAllocatorMXF</code> object and passes a pointer to this object to the DMus miniport driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dmusicks/nf-dmusicks-iminiportdmus-newstream">IMiniportDMus::NewStream</a> method. <code>IAllocatorMXF</code> inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dmusicks/nn-dmusicks-imxf">IMXF</a> interface.

<code>IAllocatorMXF</code> is the interface through which the miniport driver communicates with the port driver's internal <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/allocator">allocator</a>, which allocates and manages the reuse of a pool of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dmusicks/ns-dmusicks-_dmus_kernel_event">DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT</a> structures. Each structure can contain a time-stamped MIDI event.

The allocator also abstracts the allocation of the additional memory that is needed to store large events. The <b>uData</b> member of DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT is a union that is the size of a pointer: four bytes on a 32-bit system and eight bytes on a 64-bit system. If the data is small enough to fit in that space, then <b>uData</b> will contain the actual MIDI data. If the data for that event is larger than the 4- or 8-byte pointer, however, the <b>cbEvent</b> member indicates this fact and <b>uData</b> contains a pointer to a buffer instead of the actual MIDI data. This buffer is managed by the allocator and is a constant size for any port-driver implementation.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IAllocatorMXF</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IAllocatorMXF</b> also has these types of members:
