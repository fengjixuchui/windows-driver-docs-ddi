# IAllocatorMXF::GetBuffer


## -description


The <code>GetBuffer</code> method allocates a buffer for long MIDI events.


## -parameters




### -param ppBuffer






#### - ppbBuffer [out]

Output pointer for the buffer. This parameter points to a caller-allocated pointer variable into which the method writes a pointer to the buffer.


## -returns



<code>GetBuffer</code> returns S_OK if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.




## -remarks



The miniport driver calls this method only when it needs to send large chunks of data to the capture sink. Specifically, the miniport driver uses this method whenever a component needs to package more data than can be stored in the <b>uData</b> member of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dmusicks/ns-dmusicks-_dmus_kernel_event">DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT</a>.

The size of the buffer can determined by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dmusicks/nf-dmusicks-iallocatormxf-getbuffersize">IAllocatorMXF::GetBufferSize</a>. <code>GetBufferSize</code> needs to be called only once because the buffer size is constant for any allocator implementation.
