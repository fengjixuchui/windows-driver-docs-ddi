# IAllocatorMXF::PutBuffer


## -description



   This method is not currently used by the miniport driver. The <code>PutBuffer</code> method passes a buffer to the allocator, but this occurs automatically when <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dmusicks/nf-dmusicks-imxf-putmessage">IMXF::PutMessage</a> is called anyway.


## -parameters




### -param pBuffer






#### - pbBuffer [in]

Pointer to the buffer being passed to the allocator


## -returns



<code>PutBuffer</code> returns S_OK if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.




## -remarks



The miniport driver does not need to use this method because when the miniport driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dmusicks/nf-dmusicks-imxf-putmessage">IMXF::PutMessage</a>, the allocator looks at the <b>cbEvent</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dmusicks/ns-dmusicks-_dmus_kernel_event">DMUS_KERNEL_EVENT</a> structure to determine if <b>uData</b> is a pointer or just data. If <b>cbEvent</b> specifies that the event data is greater than the storage capacity of <b>uData</b> (4 bytes on a 32-bit system and 8 bytes on a 64-bit system), the allocator simply assumes that <b>uData</b> points to a buffer that can be reused.
