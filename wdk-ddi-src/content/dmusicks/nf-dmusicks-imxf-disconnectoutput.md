# IMXF::DisconnectOutput


## -description

The DisconnectOutput method disconnects this IMXF interface from the synth sink or capture sink.

## -parameters

### -param sinkMXF

Pointer to the destination (sink) IMXF interface that we are disconnecting from.


## -returns
This method returns NTSTATUS which contains STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.

## -remarks

This method zeros the pSinkMXF location that was previously filled in by the IMXF::ConnectOutput call.

Output will go to the allocator from the time that DisconnectOutput is called until ConnectOutput is called again.
