# ISynthSinkDMus::SampleToRefTime


## -description


The <code>SampleToRefTime</code> method converts a sample time to a reference time.


## -parameters




### -param llSampleTime [in]

Specifies the sample time being passed in.


### -param prfTime [out]

Output pointer for the reference time. This parameter is a pointer to a caller-allocated variable into which the method writes the calculated reference time. Reference time is measured in 100-nanosecond units.


## -returns



<code>SampleToRefTime</code> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.




## -remarks



The <code>SampleToRefTime</code> method accepts a sample time as an input parameter, converts the sample time to a reference time, and outputs the reference time to a location specified by the caller.

The calculation of reference time from sample time to reference time depends on the sampling frequency. For example, if the output buffer is in a 44.2 kHz format, a sample time of 44,200 is equivalent to a reference time of one second.
