# ISynthSinkDMus::Render


## -description


The <code>Render</code> method renders wave data into a destination sink.


## -parameters




### -param pBuffer [in]

Pointer to the buffer that the synth sink wants data written to


### -param dwLength [in]

Specifies the length (in bytes) of the data to be rendered.


### -param llPosition [in]

Specifies the position (in bytes) in the PCM buffer at which to begin rendering. Rendering continues from this position for the number of bytes specified in <i>dwLength</i>.


## -remarks



The port driver's synth-sink object calls this method when the miniport driver needs to render more wave data into the destination buffer.
