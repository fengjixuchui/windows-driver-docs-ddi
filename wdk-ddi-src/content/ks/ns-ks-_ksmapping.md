# _KSMAPPING structure


## -description


The KSMAPPING structure is used to describe a single contiguous chunk of physical memory for use in scatter/gather DMA operations. 


## -struct-fields




### -field PhysicalAddress

This member contains the physical address of this piece of the data frame.


### -field ByteCount

This member contains the number of bytes of contiguous physical memory in this individual mapping.


### -field Alignment

This member specifies the memory alignment in bytes for this buffer.


## -remarks



In order for minidrivers to use this structure within the stream pointer offsets, the pin for which this is referring must specify scatter/gather DMA mapping generation through KSPIN_FLAG_GENERATE_MAPPINGS and the client must register its DMA adapter object with AVStream using <b>KsDeviceRegisterAdapterObject</b>. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/avstream-dma-services">AVStream DMA Services</a>. The KSPIN_FLAG_GENERATE_MAPPINGS flag is defined on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ks/ns-ks-_kspin_descriptor_ex">KSPIN_DESCRIPTOR_EX</a> reference page.
