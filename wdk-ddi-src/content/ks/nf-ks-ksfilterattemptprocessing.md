# KsFilterAttemptProcessing function


## -description


The<b> KsFilterAttemptProcessing</b> function attempts to initiate processing on <i>Filter</i>.


## -parameters




### -param Filter [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-_ksfilter">KSFILTER</a> structure representing the AVStream filter object on which to attempt processing.


### -param Asynchronous [in]

This parameter contains an indication as to whether the processing dispatch should occur asynchronously or not (should it occur). An asynchronous dispatch is guaranteed if this is <b>TRUE</b>; however, synchronous processing dispatches are governed by conditions described below.


## -remarks



If the minidriver calls <b>KsFilterAttemptProcessing</b> when all of the conditions required to process data are met, a processing dispatch occurs. For more information about the process callback, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-_ksfilter_dispatch">KSFILTER_DISPATCH</a>. In order for the attempt to result in an actual dispatch, the filter's process control gate must be in an open state. Unlike pin-centric processing, filter-centric processing has many conditions that affect the process control gate. For more information about these requirements, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/filter-centric-processing">Filter-Centric Processing</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/pin-centric-processing">Pin-Centric Processing</a>.

If the process control gate is open, a processing dispatch occurs, either synchronously or asynchronously. If the caller specifies <b>TRUE</b> in the <i>Asynchronous</i> parameter, the processing dispatch always occurs asynchronously in a work item. However, if the caller requests a synchronous processing dispatch, the dispatch occurs synchronously only if the system is currently at an IRQL at which the minidriver can handle processing. If the system is at PASSIVE_LEVEL, the dispatch is guaranteed to happen synchronously. Conversely, if the system is at DISPATCH_LEVEL, the dispatch happens synchronously only if KSFILTER_FLAG_DISPATCH_LEVEL_PROCESSING is specified on the filter. Otherwise, a work item is queued to perform processing.

Note that this is only an attempt at processing; calling this function does not guarantee that processing will commence. Processing occurs only if the process control gate is "open." For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/restarting-processing-in-avstream">Restarting Processing in AVStream</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/flow-control-gates-in-avstream">Flow Control Gates in AVStream</a>.
