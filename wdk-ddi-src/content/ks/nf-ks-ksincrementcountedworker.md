# KsIncrementCountedWorker function


## -description


Increments the current worker count, and optionally queues the counted work item with the worker previously created by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ks/nf-ks-ksregistercountedworker">KsRegisterCountedWorker</a>.


## -parameters




### -param Worker [in]

Contains the previously allocated worker.


## -returns



Returns the current counter. A count of one implies that a worker was actually scheduled.




## -remarks



This should be called after an addition has been made to the worker's list of tasks to perform. A corresponding call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ks/nf-ks-ksdecrementcountedworker">KsDecrementCountedWorker</a> should be made within the work item after each task has been completed. This may be called at DISPATCH_LEVEL.
