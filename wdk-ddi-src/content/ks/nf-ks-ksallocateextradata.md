# KsAllocateExtraData function


## -description


The <b>KsAllocateExtraData</b> function is used with streaming IRPs to allocate a buffer to contain additional header data. A pointer to the allocated buffer is returned, and the buffer must eventually be freed by the caller. 


## -parameters




### -param Irp [in, out]

Specifies the IRP containing the stream headers. The IRP must have been previously passed to <b>KsProbeStreamIrp</b> to buffer the headers.


### -param ExtraSize [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of additional memory to allocate between each stream header. This value <i>must</i> be alignable on an eight-byte boundary. A copy of the headers is placed in the returned buffer, with the extra data size inserted between each header. This must be freed by the caller.


### -param ExtraBuffer [out]

Points to a caller-allocated pointer that, on successful completion, points to a system-allocated buffer containing the stream headers and the requested padding between them. This must be freed by the caller.


## -returns



The <b>KsAllocateExtraData</b> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if successful, or it returns a resource or access error.




## -remarks



When <b>KsAllocateExtraData</b> completes successfully, a pointer to a block of memory is returned that contains both the stream data headers from the IRP, specified at <i>Irp</i>, and padding between each header of size specified in <i>ExtraSize</i>. An example of such a resultant buffer is shown below:

When the extra buffer is no longer needed, the memory should be freed using <b>ExFreePool</b>.
