# KsGateGetStateUnsafe function


## -description


The<b> KsGateGetStateUnsafe</b> function returns the state of the given gate (open or closed)  in an unsafe manner, that is <i>without regard to synchronization</i>.


## -parameters




### -param Gate [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-_ksgate">KSGATE</a> structure representing the gate for which to return the state.


## -returns



This call returns <b>TRUE</b> if the gate is open and <b>FALSE</b> if the gate is closed.




## -remarks



Because <b>KsGateGetStateUnsafe</b> does not handle synchronization, it is possible to get a result that is not consistent with the state of the gate if the gate is in mid-transition from one state to another at the time of the call.

Consider a situation in which the output of gate A is connected as an input to gate B. A transitions to closed, causing B to transition from open to closed. If, at the same time, another thread calls <b>KsGateGetStateUnsafe</b> between the time A closes and the time B closes, the routine still returns that B was open.

<b>KsGateGetStateUnsafe</b> returns whether <i>Gate->Count</i> is greater than zero. The function does not use any interlocked functions to do this. Thus, the call is performed without regard to synchronization.
