# KsUnregisterWorker function


## -description


The <b>KsUnregisterWorker</b> function allows clients to unregister a worker. The function can destroy threads, depending on the number of threads in use. This must only be used after successful execution of <b>KsRegisterWorker</b>. The function can only be called at PASSIVE_LEVEL.


## -parameters




### -param Worker [in]

Specifies the previously allocated worker to be unregistered. The function will wait until any outstanding work item is completed.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



The client must ensure that outstanding I/O initiated on any worker thread has been completed before unregistering the worker has been completed. This means canceling or completing outstanding I/O either before unregistering the worker, or before the worker item returns from its callback for the last time and is unregistered. Unregistering of a worker will wait for any currently queued work items to complete before returning.
