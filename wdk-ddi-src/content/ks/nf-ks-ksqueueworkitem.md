# KsQueueWorkItem function


## -description

The <b>KsQueueWorkItem</b> function queues the specified work item with a worker previous created by the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksregisterworker">KsRegisterWorker</a> function.

## -parameters

### -param Worker 

[in]
Specifies the previously allocated worker.

### -param WorkItem 

[in]
Specifies the initialized work item to queue. This work item is only associated with the worker as long as the worker is on a queue. The work item must have been initialized by <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioallocateworkitem">IoAllocateWorkItem</a>.

## -returns

The <b>KsQueueWorkItem</b> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the work item was queued, or if unsuccessful the function returns an error when attempting to create a new worker if no threads are currently available.

## -remarks

The worker can only be on a queue in one place, so subsequent queuing of the worker must wait until the work item has begun executing. This function may be called at <b>DISPATCH_LEVEL</b>.
