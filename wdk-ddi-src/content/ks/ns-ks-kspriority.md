# KSPRIORITY structure


## -description


The KSPRIORITY structure is used to specify priority and is used with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/ksproperty-connection-priority">KSPROPERTY_CONNECTION_PRIORITY</a> property.


## -struct-fields




### -field PriorityClass

Specifies a number ranging from 1 to 0xFFFFFFFF, where 1 is least priority and 0xFFFFFFFF is the highest priority. Zero is reserved for future use. When setting a class value, 0xFFFFFFFF is used to indicate exclusive access to the resources consumed by the pin. Possible values are listed in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>PriorityClass</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPRIORITY_LOW

</td>
<td>
Specifies the lowest priority.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPRIORITY_NORMAL

</td>
<td>
Specifies normal priority.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPRIORITY_HIGH

</td>
<td>
Specifies an elevated priority.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSPRIORITY_EXCLUSIVE

</td>
<td>
Specifies the highest priority, which implies exclusive access to resources.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field PrioritySubClass

Specifies a number ranging from 1 to 0xFFFFFFFF, where 1 is the least priority within the class and 0xFFFFFFFF is the most priority. Zero is reserved for future use.


## -remarks



The KSPRIORITY.PrioritySubClass member allows a client to set exclusive use of resources consumed by a pin and also to prioritize the use of those resources by the client's pins within that exclusive class. The initial priority of a pin is set by the connection request typically performed through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-kscreatepin">KsCreatePin</a>, and is usually KSPRIORITY_NORMAL, with a subclass priority of 1. A pin uses these priorities as parameters when allocating shared resources from any component managing resources. Resource allocation occurs when formats are set on pins.

If the removal of resources by a higher priority client causes the filter pin to fail, the client must be notified through the KSEVENT_CONNECTION_PRIORITY event (assuming that the client had registered for event notification of this type).
