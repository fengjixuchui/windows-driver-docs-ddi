# KsInitializeDeviceProfile function


## -description

The <b>KsInitializeDeviceProfile</b> API must be called by all miniport drivers to initialize the profile store and publish the device profiles.

## -parameters

### -param FilterFactory 

[in]
This is the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-_ksfilterfactory">KSFILTERFACTORY</a> that was created by the camera driver to uniquely identify the cameraâ€™s filter factory.

## -returns

If the provided <b>KSFILTERFACTORY</b> does not contain a device interface associated with the <b>KSCATEGORY_VIDEO_CAMERA</b>, this API call will fail with <b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b>.

## -remarks

It is required that the <b>ReferenceGuid</b> field of the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-_ksfilter_descriptor">KSFILTER_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure contained with the <b>KSFILTERFACTORY</b> be set with a unique GUID for this filter type.  And the <b>Flags</b> field of the <b>KSFILTER_DESCRIPTOR</b> has the <b>KSFILTER_FLAG_PRIORITIZE_REFERENCEGUID</b> flag set.

To delete all profiles from the profile store associated with the device interface for this <b>KSFILTERFACTORY</b>, the driver may call <b>KsInitializeDeviceProfile</b> followed immediately by <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-kspersistdeviceprofile">KsPersistDeviceProfile</a>.  This would result in an empty profile information, which would remove the profile information from the profile store.
