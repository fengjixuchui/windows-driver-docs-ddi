# KsWriteFile function


## -description


The <b>KsWriteFile</b> function performs a write against the specified file object. It is assumed that the caller is serializing access to the file for operations against a FO_SYNCHRONOUS_IO file object. The function attempts to use <b>FastIoDispatch</b> if possible, or it generates a write request against the device object. All relevant statistics are updated.


## -parameters




### -param FileObject [in]

Specifies the file object to perform the read against.


### -param Event [in, optional]

Optionally contains the event to use in the write. If no event is passed, the call is assumed to be on a synchronous file object or the caller is waiting for the file object's event. If the call is not on a synchronous file object, it can be asynchronously completed. If the file has been opened for synchronous I/O, this variable must be <b>NULL</b>. If this variable is used, it must be an event allocated by the object manager.


### -param PortContext [in, optional]

Optionally contains context information for a completion port.


### -param IoStatusBlock [out]

Indicates the location in which to return the status information. This is always assumed to be a valid address, regardless of the requester mode.


### -param Buffer [in]

Specifies the buffer from which to write the data. If the buffer needs to be probed and locked, an exception handler is used, along with <i>RequesterMode</i>.


### -param Length [in]

Specifies the size of the buffer passed.


### -param OPTIONAL




### -param RequestorMode [in]

Indicates the processor mode to place in the read IRP if one needs to be generated. Additionally, it is used if a buffer needs to be probed and locked. This variable also determines if a fast I/O call can be performed. If the requester mode is not KernelMode, but the previous mode was, then fast I/O cannot be used.


#### - Key [in, optional]

Optionally contains a key, or zero if none.


## -returns



The <b>KsWriteFile</b> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if successful, STATUS_PENDING if action is pending, or it returns a read error if unsuccessful.
