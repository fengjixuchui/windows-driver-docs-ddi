# KSRATE structure


## -description

The query is passed a KSRATE structure appended to the property containing the rate request (known as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-ksrate_capability">KSRATE_CAPABILITY</a> structure), and is returned a KSRATE structure filled in with the capability given the rate request.

## -struct-fields

### -field PresentationStart

Specifies the start point for the rate in presentation time units.

### -field Duration

Specifies the duration of the rate in presentation time units.

### -field Interface

A structure of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff563537(v=vs.85)">KSPIN_INTERFACE</a> that specifies either the interface used in the connection this rate request is being sent to, or the interface of a related connection. This allows the time units to be interpreted by the pin.

### -field Rate

Specifies the rate in terms of 1/10th percentage points, where 1000 is the nominal 1.0 rate, 500 is 0.5 rate, and so on. Negative numbers indicate reverse rates.

### -field Flags

Possible flag values are listed in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSRATE_NOPRESENTATIONSTART

</td>
<td>
Specifies that there is no valid start time in this rate change request or query.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
KSRATE_NOPRESENTATIONDURATION

</td>
<td>
Specifies that there is no valid duration in this rate change request or query.
