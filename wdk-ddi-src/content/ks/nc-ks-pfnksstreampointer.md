# PFNKSSTREAMPOINTER callback function


## -description


AVStream calls a minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniCancelCallback</i> routine when the IRP that is associated with a cloned stream pointer is canceled. This routine is optional.


## -parameters




### -param StreamPointer [in]

A pointer to the clone <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ks/ns-ks-_ksstream_pointer">KSSTREAM_POINTER</a> that is associated with the IRP that was canceled. <i>StreamPointer</i> was created by a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/ks-ksstreampointerclone">KsStreamPointerClone</a>.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <i>CancelCallback</i> parameter of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/ks-ksstreampointerclone">KsStreamPointerClone</a>.

In <i>AVStrMiniCancelCallback</i>, the minidriver should set all references to the clone pointer to <b>NULL</b>.

In addition, the minidriver should remove any context information that is related to the clone pointer, and notify hardware about the cancellation.

Finally, the minidriver must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ks/nf-ks-ksstreampointerdelete">KsStreamPointerDelete</a> to delete the clone and the context associated with it. If the minidriver does not delete the clone, the IRP will retain a reference count and not complete, possibly causing related applications to crash.

<i>AVStrMiniCancelCallback</i> is called with the queue's spin lock held, hence at DISPATCH_LEVEL. Accordingly, the callback routine cannot perform queue manipulation or call functions that acquire a mutex.
