# KsRegisterCountedWorker function


## -description


Handles clients registering for use of a thread.


## -parameters




### -param WorkQueueType [in]

Contains the priority of the work thread. This is normally one of the following: CriticalWorkQueue, DelayedWorkQueue, or HyperCriticalWorkQueue.


### -param CountedWorkItem [in]

Contains a pointer to the work queue item that will be queued as needed based on the current count value.


### -param Worker [out]

Contains the opaque context that must be used when scheduling a work item. Also contains the queue type, and is used to synchronize completion of work items.


## -returns



Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if a worker was initialized.




## -remarks



This must be matched by a corresponding <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksunregisterworker">KsUnregisterWorker</a> when thread use is completed. This function resembles <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksregisterworker">KsRegisterWorker</a>, with the addition of passing the work item that will always be queued. This is to be used with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksincrementcountedworker">KsIncrementCountedWorker</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksdecrementcountedworker">KsDecrementCountedWorker</a> in order to minimize the number of work items queued, and reduce mutual exclusion code necessary in a work item needed to serialize access against multiple work item threads. The worker queue can still be used to queue other work items. This may only be called at PASSIVE_LEVEL.
