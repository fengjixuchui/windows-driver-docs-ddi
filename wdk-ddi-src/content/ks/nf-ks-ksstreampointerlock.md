# KsStreamPointerLock function


## -description

The<b> KsStreamPointerLock </b>function attempts to lock the specified stream pointer.

## -parameters

### -param StreamPointer 

[in]
A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-_ksstream_pointer">KSSTREAM_POINTER</a> structure representing the stream pointer to attempt to lock.

## -returns

<b>KsStreamPointerLock </b>returns either STATUS_SUCCESS, indicating that the stream pointer has been locked, or an appropriate error code. STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY is the usual error code indicating that the frame could not be locked. This error code frequently means that the frame to which <i>StreamPointer</i> was pointing was canceled.

## -remarks

A locked stream pointer guarantees that there is a data frame associated with the stream pointer and that this frame is not canceled as long as the lock is maintained. The minidriver should lock a stream pointer before attempting to access the data to which the stream pointer points.

If the pin that the stream pointer references specifies that DMA scatter/gather mappings should be generated using KSPIN_FLAG_GENERATE_MAPPINGS, AVStream generates the mappings when the stream pointer is locked.
