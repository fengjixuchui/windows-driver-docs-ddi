# KSDEVICE_THERMAL_STATE enumeration


## -description


 A KS-defined enumeration for thermal state changes.


## -enum-fields




### -field KSDEVICE_THERMAL_STATE_LOW

This represents the LOW value for thermal notifications. This is usually determined by the Avstream driver and conveyed to KS in response to the thermal notification callbacks.


### -field KSDEVICE_THERMAL_STATE_HIGH

This represents the HIGH value for thermal notifications. This is usually determined by the Avstream driver and conveyed to KS in response to the thermal notification callbacks.
