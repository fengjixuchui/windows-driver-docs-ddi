# KSHANDSHAKE structure


## -description

The KSHANDSHAKE structure is used to pass information back and forth while pins are handshaking in an attempt to negotiate a private interface.

## -struct-fields

### -field ProtocolId

This member specifies the GUID that represents the interface or protocol being negotiated between two AVStream pins.

### -field Argument1

A pointer to an interface-dependent argument. Most often, this is used to pass back and forth COM-style interface pointers once a specific private interface or protocol has been agreed upon.

### -field Argument2

A pointer to an interface-dependent argument.

## -remarks

See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-kspinhandshake">KsPinHandshake</a> for more information about negotiating private interfaces between AVStream pins.

Pin handshaking is a concept that is usable only between two pins that support IOCTL_KS_HANDSHAKE. Currently, only AVStream pins support this interface; thus this is only useful for negotiating private interfaces between two AVStream pins. Currently, connections between AVStream pins are negotiated via this mechanism.
