# PFNKSFILTERVOID callback function


## -description


An AVStream minidriver's <i>AVStrMiniFilterReset</i> routine is called when AVStream receives an IOCTL_KS_RESET_STATE to return the filter to the state it was in at <i>Acquire</i>-time. This routine is also called when a queue associated with a pin on the filter is flushed. <i>This routine will only be called for a filter-centric filter</i>.


## -parameters




### -param Filter [in]

Pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-_ksfilter">KSFILTER</a> to return to its previous state.


## -returns



AVStream does not currently use the return value.




## -remarks



For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/filter-centric-processing">Filter-Centric Processing</a>.

Note that it is not the filter in question, but rather a pin on this filter that actually receives the reset IOCTL.

The minidriver specifies this routine's address in the <b>Reset</b> member of its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ns-ks-_ksfilter_dispatch">KSFILTER_DISPATCH</a> structure.

The filter control mutex may be held during this function. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/filter-control-mutex-in-avstream">Filter Control Mutex in AVStream</a>.

This routine is optional.
