# KsDecrementCountedWorker function


## -description

Decrements the current worker count of a worker previous created by <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksregistercountedworker">KsRegisterCountedWorker</a>. This should be called after each task within a worker has been completed.

## -parameters

### -param Worker 

[in]
Contains the previously allocated worker.

## -returns

Returns the current counter. A count of zero implies that the task list has been completed.

## -remarks

<b>KsDecrementCountedWorker</b> should be called after each task within a worker has been completed. A corresponding call to <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/nf-ks-ksincrementcountedworker">KsIncrementCountedWorker</a> would have previously incremented the count. <b>KsDecrementCountedWorker</b> may be called at DISPATCH_LEVEL.
