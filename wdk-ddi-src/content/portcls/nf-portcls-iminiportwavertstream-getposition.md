# IMiniportWaveRTStream::GetPosition


## -description

The GetPosition method retrieves the current play or record position as a byte offset from the beginning of the buffer.

## -parameters

### -param Position
Pointer to a KSAUDIO_POSITION structure. For a wave rendering stream, the method writes the write position and the play position into this structure. For a wave-capture stream, the method writes the read position and the record position into the structure. Positions are specified as byte offsets from the beginning of the cyclic buffer.

## -returns
This method returns NTSTATUS which contains STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, the function returns an appropriate error status code.

## -remarks

The WaveRT port driver calls this method in response to a KSPROPERTY_AUDIO_POSITION property request from a client.
