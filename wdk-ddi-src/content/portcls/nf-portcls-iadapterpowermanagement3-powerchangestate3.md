## -description

PortCls calls the PowerChangeState3 method to request a change to the new power state. This request is passed on to the adapter driver.

## -parameters

### -param NewDeviceState

The new power state that Portcls has requested for the device. This parameter is an enumeration of type DEVICE_POWER_STATE.

### -param NewSystemState

The new power state that Portcls has requested for the system. This parameter is an enumeration of type SYSTEM_POWER_STATE.

### -param D3ExitLatency
The acceptable exit latency for the state into which the device is put when the device comes out of PowerDeviceD3. This parameter is an enumeration of type PC_EXIT_LATENCY.


## -remarks
If the device is not going into its new state from PowerDeviceD3, then D3ExitLatency is set to PcExitLatencyInstant. For more information about the possible values for D3ExitLatency, see [D3ExitLatencyChanged](nf-portcls-iadapterpowermanagement3-d3exitlatencychanged.md).
