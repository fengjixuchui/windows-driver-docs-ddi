# IServiceGroup::RemoveMember


## -description


The <code>RemoveMember</code> method removes the specified member from the service group.


## -parameters




### -param pServiceSink [in]

Pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/portcls/nn-portcls-iservicesink">IServiceSink</a> interface of the member that is to be removed


## -remarks



The <code>RemoveMember</code> method removes a service sink that was previously added to the service group by an <b>AddMember</b> call. The <b>AddMember</b> method called <b>AddRef</b> on the service sink object, and the <code>RemoveMember</code> method calls <b>Release</b> on the service sink object. This behavior is in accordance with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/reference-counting-conventions-for-com-objects">reference-counting conventions for COM objects</a>.
