# IMiniportWaveRTStream::GetHWLatency


## -description

The GetHWLatency method retrieves information about sources of stream latency in the audio hardware.

## -parameters

### -param hwLatency

A pointer to a KSRTAUDIO_HWLATENCY structure into which the driver writes the hardware latency parameters.

## -remarks

The port driver calls this method in response to a KSPROPERTY_RTAUDIO_HWLATENCY property request from a client.
For more information about the sources of hardware latency in an audio stream, see the Stream Latency during Playback and Stream Latency during Recording topics.
