# IDmaChannel::CopyFrom


## -description

The CopyFrom method copies sample data from the DMA channel's common buffer to the specified destination buffer.

## -parameters

### -param Destination
Pointer to the destination buffer


### -param Source
Pointer to the source buffer, which is located in the DMA channel's common buffer.



### -param ByteCount
Specifies the number of bytes to be copied.



## -remarks

The Source and Destination pointers are both kernel-mode virtual addresses. The IDmaChannel::SystemAddress call returns the virtual address of a DMA channel's common buffer.

The Source parameter points to the beginning of the source buffer, which occupies ByteCount contiguous bytes in the DMA channel's common buffer.
