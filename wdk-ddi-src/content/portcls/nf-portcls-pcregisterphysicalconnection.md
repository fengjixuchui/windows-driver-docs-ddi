# PcRegisterPhysicalConnection function


## -description


The <b>PcRegisterPhysicalConnection</b> function registers a physical connection between two audio adapter filters that are instantiated by the same adapter driver.


## -parameters




### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the device object for the adapter device. This parameter must point to a system structure of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_device_object">DEVICE_OBJECT</a>.


### -param FromUnknown [in]

Pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/portcls/nn-portcls-iport">IPort</a> interface of a port driver object. The port driver object that is associated with <i>FromUnknown</i> is bound to the subdevice that supplies the connection's data source (output) pin.


### -param FromPin [in]

Specifies a pin ID. This parameter identifies the source (output) pin on the filter that is associated with the <i>FromUnknown</i> interface.


### -param ToUnknown [in]

Pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/portcls/nn-portcls-iport">IPort</a> interface of a port driver object. The port driver object that is associated with <i>ToUnknown</i> is bound to the subdevice that supplies the connection's data sink (input) pin.


### -param ToPin [in]

Specifies a pin ID. This parameter identifies the sink (input) pin on the filter that is associated with the <i>ToUnknown</i> interface.


## -returns



<b>PcRegisterPhysicalConnection</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code.




## -remarks



An adapter driver calls <b>PcRegisterPhysicalConnection</b> to register a physical connection with the PortCls system driver. PortCls stores this information so that the port driver can subsequently use the information to respond to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/ksproperty-pin-physicalconnection">KSPROPERTY_PIN_PHYSICALCONNECTION</a> property requests.

The parameters that the caller provides to the <b>PcRegisterPhysicalConnection</b> function describe a physical connection between two subdevices (represented as individual filters) on the same adapter card.

Unlike a logical connection between two pins, which can be configured under software control, a physical connection is hardwired. For example, a typical adapter card might have a physical connection that carries the analog signal from the output pin of its wave-output filter to the input pin of its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/topology-filters">topology filter</a>.

For an example of an adapter driver's device-startup routine (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/startup-sequence">Startup Sequence</a>) that uses the <b>PcRegisterPhysicalConnection</b> call to register an adapter's physical connections, see the source code for the SB16 sample audio driver in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

An adapter driver can call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/portcls/nf-portcls-iunregisterphysicalconnection-unregisterphysicalconnection">IUnregisterPhysicalConnection::UnregisterPhysicalConnection</a> method to delete the registration of a physical connection that was registered by a previous call to <b>PcRegisterPhysicalConnection</b>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/dynamic-audio-subdevices">Dynamic Audio Subdevices</a>.
