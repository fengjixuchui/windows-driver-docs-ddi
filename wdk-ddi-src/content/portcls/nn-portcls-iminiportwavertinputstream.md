# IMiniportWaveRTInputStream interface


## -description


The <code>IMiniportWaveRTInputStream</code> interface represents the input wave stream that flows through a pin on the KS filter that wraps a WaveRT rendering or capture device. <code>IMiniportWaveRTInputStream</code> inherits from the <b>IUnknown</b> interface.

A driver can implement this interface for better coordination of audio dataflow from the driver to OS. If this interface is available on a capture stream, the OS uses methods on this interface to access data in the WaveRt buffer. 
     <code>IMiniportWaveRTInputStream</code> is supported in WindowsÂ 10 and later.
