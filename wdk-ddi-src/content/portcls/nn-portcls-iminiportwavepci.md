# IMiniportWavePci interface


## -description


The <code>IMiniportWavePci</code> interface is the primary interface that is exposed by the miniport driver for a WavePci audio device. The WavePci port driver communicates with the miniport driver through this interface. The adapter driver creates the WavePci miniport object and passes the object's <b>IMiniportPci</b> interface pointer to the WavePci port driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/portcls/nf-portcls-iport-init">IPort::Init</a> method (see code example in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/subdevice-creation">Subdevice Creation</a>). <code>IMiniportWavePci</code> inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/portcls/nn-portcls-iminiport">IMiniport</a> interface.

An adapter driver forms a miniport/port driver pair by binding an <code>IMiniportWavePci</code> object to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff536905(v=vs.85)">IPortWavePci</a> object. The PortCls system driver registers this pair with the system as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/wave-filters">wave filter</a>.

The <code>IMiniportWavePci</code> interface provides a method for initializing the miniport object, a method for creating a miniport stream object, and a method for notifying the miniport driver of a service request. The stream object is associated with a pin on the WavePci filter, which the adapter driver forms by binding the miniport object with the port object.
