# IPortWMIRegistration interface


## -description

The <code>IPortWMIRegistration</code> interface is provided in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows. This interface allows the miniport driver to coordinate Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) registration between PortCls and the miniport driver.

ETW provides a mechanism to trace and log events that are raised by user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers. For more information about ETW, see <a href="/windows-hardware/test/wpt/event-tracing-for-windows">Event Tracing for Windows</a> and <a href="/archive/msdn-magazine/2007/april/event-tracing-improve-debugging-and-performance-tuning-with-etw">Improve Debugging And Performance Tuning With ETW</a>.
