# FwpsCompleteOperation0 function


## -description


The 
  <b>FwpsCompleteOperation0</b> function is called by a callout to resume packet processing that was suspended
  pending completion of another operation.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <b>FwpsCompleteOperation0</b> is a specific version of <b>FwpsCompleteOperation</b>. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/FWP/wfp-version-independent-names-and-targeting-specific-versions-of-windows">WFP Version-Independent Names and Targeting Specific Versions of Windows</a> for more information.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param completionContext [in]

A completion context handle that was previously created by a call to the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/fwpsk/nf-fwpsk-fwpspendoperation0">FwpsPendOperation0</a> function.


### -param netBufferList [in, optional]

A pointer to a 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_buffer_list">NET_BUFFER_LIST</a> structure that describes
     the packet data for which processing has been suspended pending completion of another operation.


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



When the callout is ready to resume packet processing after operations on the packet were suspended by
    a call to 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/fwpsk/nf-fwpsk-fwpspendoperation0">FwpsPendOperation0</a>, the callout should
    call the 
    <b>FwpsCompleteOperation0</b> function, passing it the 
    <i>completionContext</i> parameter value from 
    <b>FwpsPendOperation0</b> and the net buffer
    list data that describes the packet.

To complete a connection that was previously pended at the FWPS_LAYER_ALE_AUTH_RECV_ACCEPT_<i>Xxx</i> layer, the callout driver must reinject the packet that was cloned at that layer, and the
    callout should also call 
    <b>FwpsCompleteOperation0</b>.

Pended connections are authenticated again after the 
    <b>FwpsCompleteOperation0</b> function executes. TCP connections, if allowed, are created by completing
    the handshake operation, but non-TCP connections just create state entries. Any pended packet data
    is flushed from memory when the 
    <b>FwpsPendOperation0</b> function completes, so an application will have to retransmit those packets
    after 
    <b>FwpsCompleteOperation0</b> executes. The callout could buffer such data and reinject the data on the
    application's behalf.
