# FWPS_PACKET_INJECTION_STATE_ enumeration


## -description


The FWPS_PACKET_INJECTION_STATE enumeration type specifies the injection state of a network buffer
  list.


## -enum-fields




### -field FWPS_PACKET_NOT_INJECTED

The packet was not injected by any of the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/packet-injection-functions">packet injection functions</a>. A
     packet that originated from the TCP/IP stack will be at this state.


### -field FWPS_PACKET_INJECTED_BY_SELF

The packet was injected using an injection handle passed by a call to one of the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/packet-injection-functions">packet injection functions</a>.


### -field FWPS_PACKET_INJECTED_BY_OTHER

The packet was injected using an injection handle other than one passed by a call
     to one of the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/packet-injection-functions">packet injection functions</a>.


### -field FWPS_PACKET_PREVIOUSLY_INJECTED_BY_SELF

The packet was injected by using an injection handle passed by a call to one of the
     
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/packet-injection-functions">packet injection functions</a>, but
     the packet was later cloned and reinjected by an additional call to a packet injection function,
     possibly using a different injection handle.


### -field FWPS_PACKET_INJECTION_STATE_MAX

The maximum value for this enumeration. This value might change in future versions of the NDIS
     header files and binaries.
