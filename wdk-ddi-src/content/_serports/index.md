# Serial port

## -description

Overview of the Serial port technology.

To develop Serial port, you need these headers:

 * [sercx.h](../sercx/index.md)
 * [sercxfuncenum.h](../sercxfuncenum/index.md)
 * [serfuncenum.h](../serfuncenum/index.md)
 * [uart.h](../uart/index.md)

For the programming guide, see [Serial port](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/serports).
