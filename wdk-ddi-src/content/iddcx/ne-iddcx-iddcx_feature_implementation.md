# IDDCX_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION enumeration


## -description



                    Enum used to indicate how a given supported feature is implemented
                


## -enum-fields




### -field IDDCX_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_UNINITIALIZED


                        
                    Indicates that an <b>IDDCX_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION</b> variable has not yet been assigned a meaningful value.


### -field IDDCX_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_NONE


                        The feature is not implemented
                    


### -field IDDCX_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_HARDWARE


                        The feature is implemented and hardware is used in the implementation. For example, the adapter/ display pipeline blends the hardware cursor image into the signal sent to the monitor.
                    


### -field IDDCX_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_SOFTWARE


                        The feature is implemented and software is used in the implementation. For example, the driver/ support hardware cursor by blending the cursor image into the display pixels as part of the processing.
                    


### -field UINT
