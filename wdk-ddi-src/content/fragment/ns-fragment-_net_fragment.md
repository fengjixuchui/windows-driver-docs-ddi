Represents one contiguous buffer in memory.

## -struct-fields

### -field ValidLength

Contains the length of packet payload. This value is less than or equal to the value of **Capacity**.

For transmit queues, this value is read-only.

### -field Capacity

Contains the total length of the packet buffer.

For transmit queues, this value is read-only.

### -field Offset

Contains the offset from the start of the **VirtualAddress** and **DmaLogicalAddress** to the start of the valid packet payload. This value is less than or equal to the value of **Capacity**.

For transmit queues, this value is read-only.

### -field Scratch

A bit field value that the client may use for any purpose. When the [**NET_PACKET**](../packet/ns-packet-_net_packet.md) to which this fragment belongs is reused, this value is reset to zero.

### -field Reserved0

Reserved. Client drivers must not read or write to this value.

### -field OsReserved_Bounced

Reserved. Client drivers must not read or write to this value.

### -field Reserved

Reserved. Client drivers must not read or write to this value.

### -field VirtualAddress

Points to the start of the packet buffer. This address is mapped into the system address space.

For transmit queues, this value is read-only.

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME

A union that contains the fragment's return context and the **Mapping** union for DMA information.

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME

A structure that contains the fragment's return context.

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.RxBufferReturnContext

A pointer to a driver-allocated context space structure. This member is optional and is only used in the receive data path.

For more information about receive path capabilities, see [**NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES**](../netadapter/ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md).

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.Mapping

A union that contains information for DMA.
 
### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.Mapping.Mdl

For transmit queues, a pointer to an MDL to be used for scatter/gather DMA.

For receive queues, this member is not used.

Do not modify this value.
 
### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.Mapping.DmaLogicalAddress

For receive queues, contains a mapped DMA address that can be used to program NIC hardware.

For transmit queues, cast this value to an MDL pointer.

Do not modify this value.
 
## -remarks

The **NET_FRAGMENT** structure is similar in concept to a memory descriptor list (MDL).

A single [**NET_PACKET**](../packet/ns-packet-_net_packet.md) structure contains references to one or more **NET_FRAGMENT** structures.

While each fragment is a virtually contiguous buffer of memory, a packet that contains more than one fragment is virtually discontiguous.

The client driver should not unlink, append, or rearrange **NET_FRAGMENT** structures within a [**NET_PACKET**](../packet/ns-packet-_net_packet.md) structure.
