# RILC2KMRL structure


## -description


<div class="alert"><b>Warning</b>  The Cellular COM API is deprecated in Windows 10. This content is provided to support maintenance of OEM and mobile operator created Windows Phone 8.1 applications.</div><div> </div>This structure represents a RILC2KMRL.


## -syntax


```cpp
struct RILC2KMRL {
  DWORD dwParams;
  BOOL  fServing;
  DWORD dwNID;
  DWORD dwSID;
  DWORD dwBaseStationID;
  DWORD dwBaseLat;
  DWORD dwBaseLong;
  DWORD dwRefPN;
  DWORD dwGPSSeconds;
  DWORD dwPilotStrength;
};
```


## -struct-fields




### -field dwParams

A bitwise combination of RILC2KMRLPARAMMASK enumeration values that indicates which members of the structure contain valid data. A member of the structure is valid if the corresponding bit flag is set.


### -field fServing

Indicates whether this is a serving cell. There may be more than one serving cell at a time.


### -field dwNID

Network ID (0...65535).


### -field dwSID

System ID (0...32767).


### -field dwBaseStationID

Base station ID (0...65535).


### -field dwBaseLat

Base station Latitude (0...4194303) encoded in units of 0.25 seconds, expressed in two’s complement representation within the low 22 bits of the DWORD. This is a signed field with North latitudes represented by positive values.


### -field dwBaseLong

Base station Longitude (0...8388607) encoded in units of 0.25 seconds, expressed in two’s complement representation within the low 23 bits of the DWORD. This is a signed field with East longitudes represented by positive values.


### -field dwRefPN

Base station PN number (0...511).


### -field dwGPSSeconds

GPS seconds; the time at which this arrived from the base station.


### -field dwPilotStrength

Signal strength of pilot (0...63).
