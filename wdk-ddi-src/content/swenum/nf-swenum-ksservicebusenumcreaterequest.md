# KsServiceBusEnumCreateRequest function


## -description


<i>This function is intended for internal use only.</i>

The <b>KsServiceBusEnumCreateRequest</b> function services IRP_MJ_CREATE requests for the software bus device interface. 


## -parameters




### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the device object.


### -param Irp [in, out]

Pointer to the IRP that is associated with the device object.


## -returns



Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if successful. Otherwise. it returns STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND if the IRP's <i>FileObject->FileName</i> is <b>NULL</b> or if the reference string cannot be located. Otherwise, an appropriate error returns.




## -remarks



<b>KsServiceBusEnumCreateRequest</b> services the IRP_MJ_CREATE request for the registered device interface by matching the given IRP's<i> FileObject->FileName</i> with the registered bus reference strings. If the device reference is present, enumerated and created, the IRP is simply re-routed to the actual device. If the reference string is <b>NULL</b>, it is assumed that this is a request for the bus interface and the IRP_MJ_CREATE is completed. If the device reference has not already been enumerated, or is not active, the IRP is queued and a PDO is created and a bus enumeration is initiated by IoInvalidateDeviceRelations().
