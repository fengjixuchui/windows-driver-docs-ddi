# SPB_TRANSFER_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>SPB_TRANSFER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes a single transfer in an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/i-o-transfer-sequences">I/O transfer sequence</a>.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of the entire structure.  Used for versioning.


### -field Direction

The direction of the transfer.  This member is set to one of the following <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/spb/ne-spb-spb_transfer_direction">SPB_TRANSFER_DIRECTION</a> enumeration values:

<ul>
<li><b>SpbTransferDirectionFromDevice</b></li>
<li><b>SpbTransferDirectionToDevice</b></li>
</ul>

### -field TransferLength

The number of bytes of data to be transferred.


### -field DelayInUs

An optional delay, in microseconds, before this transfer begins. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks



This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/spbcx/nf-spbcx-spbrequestgettransferparameters">SpbRequestGetTransferParameters</a> method. Before passing an <b>SPB_TRANSFER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure to this method, initialize the structure by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/spbcx/nf-spbcx-spb_transfer_descriptor_init">SPB_TRANSFER_DESCRIPTOR_INIT</a> function.

The <b>DelayInUs</b> member specifies a delay before the start of the transfer. In certain cases, a peripheral driver might need to insert a delay between two consecutive transfers in a sequence. For example, if a write to a target device specifies the type of information that is being requested, this device might need time to process the request before the information can be read. In addition, a peripheral driver might need to specify a delay before the first transfer in a sequence. In this case, the controller must apply the address or assert the device-select  line to the target device for the specified delay interval before the start of the first transfer.
