# _GETVERSIONINPARAMS structure


## -description


The GETVERSIONINPARAMS structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff566202(v=vs.85)">SMART_GET_VERSION</a> request to retrieve version information, a capabilities mask, and a bitmask for the indicated device. 


## -struct-fields




### -field bVersion

Contains an integer that indicates the version number of the binary driver. 


### -field bRevision

Contains an integer that indicates the revision number of the binary driver. 


### -field bReserved

Reserved. 


### -field bIDEDeviceMap

Contains the bitmap. The following table explains the meaning of the bitmap:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Bitmap Flags</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 0 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is either a SATA drive or an IDE drive. If it is an IDE drive, it is the master device on the primary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 1 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an IDE drive, and it is the subordinate device on the primary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 2 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an IDE drive, and it is the master device on the secondary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 3 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an IDE drive, and it is the subordinate device on the secondary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 4 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an ATAPI drive, and it is the master device on the primary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 5 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an ATAPI drive, and it is the subordinate device on the primary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 6 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an ATAPI drive, and it is the master device on the secondary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Bit 7 is set to 1.

</td>
<td>
The device is an ATAPI drive, and it is the subordinate device on the secondary channel. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field fCapabilities

Contains the bitmask of driver capabilities. 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Bitmask Flags</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CAP_ATA_ID_CMD

</td>
<td>
The device supports the ATA ID command. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CAP_ATAPI_ID_CMD

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CAP_SMART_CMD

</td>
<td>
The device supports SMART commands.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field dwReserved

Reserved.
