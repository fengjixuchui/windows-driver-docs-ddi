The **NetRxQueueGetExtension** method retrieves a packet extension for all packets in a receive (Rx) queue.

## -parameters

### -param PacketQueue

The receive queue object.

### -param Query

A pointer to a driver-allocated and initialized [**NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_QUERY**](../netadapterpacket/ns-netadapterpacket-_net_packet_extension_query.md) structure that contains information about the desired packet extension.

### -param Extension

A handle to a driver-allocated [**NET_EXTENSION**](../extension/ns-extension-_net_extension.md) structure that receives the packet extension.

## -returns

None.

## -remarks

Client drivers typically call this method from their *[EvtNetAdapterCreateRxQueue](../netadapter/nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_create_txqueue.md)* callback function after queue creation. To prevent frequent extension queries, store the extension returned by this method in your queue context space.
