# _DXVA_AYUVsample2 structure


## -description


The DXVA_AYUVsample2 structure is sent by the host decoder to the accelerator to specify Y, Cb, Cr color values, and an associated opacity.


## -struct-fields




### -field bCrValue

Specifies a chrominance (Cr) sample value (scaled per ITU-R Rec. BT.601) as an unsigned value. Thus, the color black is nominally specified by Y=16, Cb=Cr=128, and the color white is nominally specified by Y=235, Cb=Cr=128.


### -field bCbValue

Specifies a chrominance (Cb) sample value (scaled per ITU-R Rec. BT.601) as an unsigned value. Thus, the color black is nominally specified by Y=16, Cb=Cr=128, and the color white is nominally specified by Y=235, Cb=Cr=128.


### -field bY_Value

Specifies a luminance (Y) sample value (scaled per ITU-R Rec. BT.601) as an unsigned value. Thus, the color black is nominally specified by Y=16, Cb=Cr=128, and the color white is nominally specified by Y=235, Cb=Cr=128.


### -field bSampleAlpha8

Specifies the opacity of the pixel when used as a source graphic for blending with another picture. For Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows XP SP2, the opacity level is not used and should be ignored by the driver.


## -remarks



A value of zero for <b>bSampleAlpha8</b> indicates that the pixel is transparent (so that the other entries have no effect on the resulting blended picture), and a value of 255 indicates that the pixel is opaque (so that the other entries completely determine the value of the resulting blended picture sample). 

For nonzero values of <b>bSampleAlpha8</b>, the blend to use is calculated by the following expression:

( ( ( (<b>bSampleAlpha8</b>+1) x (graphic value) ) + ( (255 - <b>bSampleAlpha8</b>) x (picture value) ) )  + 128 ) >> 8

For a zero value of <b>bSampleAlpha8</b>, the specified blend to use is the picture value without alteration. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    If the alpha-blending surface originates as a DVD video subpicture, the preferred method for converting from the 4-bit alpha used by DVD video to the 8-bit alpha specified by <b>bSampleAlpha8</b> is to map a 4-bit alpha value of zero to an 8-bit alpha value of zero and to convert all nonzero 4-bit alphas to 8-bit alphas by performing a left shift of four places and adding the constant 15.</div>
<div> </div>
The width and height of the AYUV alpha-blending surface are specified in the associated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/buffer-description-list">buffer description list</a> defined by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dxva/ns-dxva-_dxva_bufferdescription">DXVA_BufferDescription</a> structure.

The <b>DXVA_AYUVsample2</b> structure is used for each sample in a DirectX VA AYUV blending surface, for <b>OutsideYUVcolor</b> in a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dxva/ns-dxva-_dxva_blendcombination">DXVA_BlendCombination</a> structure, and for each of the entries in a 16-entry AYUV alpha-blending palette.
