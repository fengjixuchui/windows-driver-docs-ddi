# WdfObjectReleaseLock callback


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]</p>

The <b>WdfObjectReleaseLock</b> method releases an object's synchronization lock.

## -parameters

### -param DriverGlobals

### -param WDFOBJECT

#### - Object [in]

A handle to a framework device object or a framework queue object.

## -prototype

```cpp
VOID WdfObjectReleaseLock(
  _In_ WDFOBJECT Object
);
```

## -remarks

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.

The <b>WdfObjectReleaseLock</b> method releases the synchronization lock that a driver acquired by previously calling <a href="/previous-versions/ff548721(v=vs.85)">WdfObjectAcquireLock</a>. <b>WdfObjectReleaseLock</b> also restores the driver's IRQL to the value that it had before the driver called <b>WdfObjectAcquireLock</b>.
