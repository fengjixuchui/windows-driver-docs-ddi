# IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD IOCTL


## -description



The IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD request removes a local SDP record that the profile driver previously
     submitted. The local server will no longer offer this record to remote devices.




## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member contains an SDP connection handle from which to remove the SDP
      record. This must be a handle returned from a call to 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/bthioctl/ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_sdp_submit_record">IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD</a> or 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/bthioctl/ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_sdp_submit_record_with_info">
      IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD_WITH_INFO</a>. Handles from other sources are invalid in this
      context.


### -input-buffer-length

The length of the buffer.


### -output-buffer

None.


### -output-buffer-length

None.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

The 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to zero.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
The IOCTL completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED

</td>
<td>
The remote SDP server is disconnected.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

</td>
<td>
The SDP connection handle passed in the input buffer is invalid.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_NOT_FOUND

</td>
<td>
The SDP connection handle passed in the input buffer was not found.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -remarks



If the record to be removed was published using IOCTL_BTH_SDP_SUBMIT_RECORD_WITH_INFO, this indicates
    that class of device (CoD) bits were set. In this case, calling IOCTL_BTH_SDP_REMOVE_RECORD might cause
    the CoD bits to be cleared. The bits will remain set if another client has set them but has not called
    this IOCTL.
