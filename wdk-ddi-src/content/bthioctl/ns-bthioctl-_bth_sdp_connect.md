# _BTH_SDP_CONNECT structure


## -description

The BTH_SDP_CONNECT structure contains input and output information about a connection between the
  local Bluetooth system and a remote SDP server. This structure is passed as the input buffer and output
  buffer of 
  <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_sdp_connect">IOCTL_BTH_SDP_CONNECT</a>.

## -struct-fields

### -field bthAddress

The address of the remote SDP server that the local system connects to. This address cannot be to
     the local radio.

### -field fSdpConnect

A flag or combination of flags that determines how to handle the connection request. Valid flag
     values are listed in the following table.
     

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SDP_CONNECT_ALLOW_PIN

</td>
<td>
If requested, perform a pin exchange with the remote device.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
SDP_CONNECT_CACHE

</td>
<td>
Requests are serviced out of the local cache of the SDP record.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### -field HANDLE_SDP_FIELD_NAME

### -field requestTimeout

The timeout, in seconds, for requests to the SDP connection handle that is returned in the 
     <b>hConnection</b> member. If the request times out, the SDP connection returned in 
     <b>hConnection</b> must be closed. The values for this field are bound by SDP_REQUEST_TO_MIN and
     SDP_REQUEST_TO_MAX. If SDP_REQUEST_TO_DEFAULT is specified, the timeout is 30 seconds.


#### - hConnection

A handle for the SDP connection on the remote server.
