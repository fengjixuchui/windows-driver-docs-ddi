# IOCTL_BTH_HCI_VENDOR_COMMAND IOCTL


## -description

     The IOCTL_BTH_HCI_VENDOR_COMMAND request allows Bluetooth applications to send vendor-specific
     commands to radios.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a 
      <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_specific_command">BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND</a> structure. The structure contains a manufacturer identifier, a link
      management protocol (LMP) version, an HCI command header, and the associated vendor command data that
      includes optional pattern data to match an event to the command.

### -input-buffer-length

The length of a 
      <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_specific_command">BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND</a> structure.

### -output-buffer

The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a buffer that contains the event data returned from the radio. The data is available in the <b>EventInfo</b> member of the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_event_info">BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO</a> structure.


```
typedef struct _BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO {
  BTH_ADDR BthAddress;
  ULONG    EventSize;
  UCHAR    EventInfo[1];
} BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO, *PBTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO;
```

The <b>EventSize</b> member provides the size of the vendor-specific event data returned from the radio.

### -output-buffer-length

The length of a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_event_info">BTH_VENDOR_EVENT_INFO</a> structure.

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

If the request is successful, the 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to the size, in bytes, of the buffer that
      holds the command response.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
The IOCTL completed successfully.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL

</td>
<td>
The input buffer that was passed was too small.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

</td>
<td>
The input buffer that was passed was invalid.

<td>
The caller does not have the required privileges.

<td>
There was insufficient memory available to process the request.

## -remarks

The IOCTL_BTH_HCI_VENDOR_COMMAND request provides a mechanism that allows vendors to create commands
    that are specific to their Bluetooth radios.

The manufacturer ID and link management protocol (LMP) version values that are in the 
    <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_specific_command">
    BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND</a> structure help to prevent the sending of vendor-specific commands to
    the wrong radio. The LMP version enables the vendors to send vendor-specific commands to radios that have
    a matching LMP version. If the LMP version is zero, all radios from that vendor will receive the
    vendor-specific command.

Patterns are required if a vendor-specific command does not follow the standard HCI flow control and a
    vendor-specific event is generated in response to the vendor-specific command.

If patterns are required, the command should be followed by 
    <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_vendor_pattern">BTH_VENDOR_PATTERN</a> structures for patterns
    that are present in the event. These patterns allow the Bluetooth driver stack to match vendor-specific
    events with the corresponding vendor-specific commands.

The BTH_VENDOR_PATTERN structure specifies such patterns that follow the vendor-specific command data
    that is specified in the 
    <b>Data</b> member of BTH_VENDOR_SPECIFIC_COMMAND structure. The maximum total size of all the patterns
    that follow the command should not be greater than 255.

<div class="alert"><b>Warning</b>  The process that submits IOCTL_BTH_HCI_VENDOR_COMMAND must have the
    SE_LOAD_DRIVER_NAME privilege. A process that is running in the system or an administrator context can
    elevate its privilege by using the SDK 
    <b>LookupPrivilegeValue</b> and 
    <b>AdjustTokenPrivileges</b> functions. The following code example demonstrates how to obtain this
    privilege. Note that the example does not demonstrate error handling.</div>
<div> </div>

```
HANDLE procToken;
LUID luid;
TOKEN_PRIVILEGES tp;

OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES | TOKEN_QUERY, &procToken);

LookupPrivilegeValue(NULL, SE_LOAD_DRIVER_NAME, &luid);

Tp.PrivilegeCount = 1;
Tp.privileges[0].Luid = luid;
Tp.Privileges[0].Attributes = SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED;

AdjustTokenPrivileges(procToken, FALSE, &tp, sizeof(TOKEN_PRIVILEGES), (PTOKEN_PRIVILEGES) NULL, (PDWORD)NULL);
```

The event that is generated because of this command is copied into the output buffer (including the
    event header).
