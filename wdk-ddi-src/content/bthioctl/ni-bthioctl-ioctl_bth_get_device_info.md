# IOCTL_BTH_GET_DEVICE_INFO IOCTL


## -description



The IOCTL_BTH_GET_DEVICE_INFO request returns information about all cached, previously discovered
     remote radios that are Bluetooth-enabled.




## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a buffer for a 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_device_info_list">BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST</a> structure.


### -input-buffer-length

The length of a 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_device_info_list">BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST</a> structure


### -output-buffer

The 
      <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a buffer that holds a 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ns-bthioctl-_bth_device_info_list">BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST</a> structure. The 
      <b>numOfDevices</b> member of the BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure contains the number of devices for
      which there is information and an array of 
      <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=50713">BTH_DEVICE_INFO</a> structures; one array
      entry for each device.


### -output-buffer-length

If the size of the passed output buffer is not exactly <code>sizeof(BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST)</code> plus the correct multiple of <code>sizeof(BTH_DEVICE_INFO)</code>, the request will fail with STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

If the request is successful, the 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to the size, in bytes, of the buffer that
      holds information about the array of devices. The BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure contains storage for
      the first BTH_DEVICE_INFO structure, so if no devices are returned, the 
      <b>Information</b> member is set to the size of the first structure.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
The IOCTL completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER

</td>
<td>
The input buffer passed in was <b>NULL</b>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_INVALID_BUFFER_SIZE

</td>
<td>
The output buffer was not sized correctly.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -remarks



The IOCTL_BTH_GET_DEVICE_INFO IOCTL provides information about all previously discovered remote
    radios.

The 
    <b>numOfDevices</b> member of the BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure returns the total number of
    BTH_DEVICE_INFO structures that are returned by the IOCTL. If the calling driver passes in a buffer that
    is smaller than the value of the 
    <b>numOfDevices</b> member, only a portion of the available structures will be returned. Bluetooth driver
    developers should call IOCTL_BTH_GET_DEVICE_INFO with a small buffer first, for example 
    <code>sizeof(BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST)</code>, and then use the returned 
    <b>numOfDevices</b> member to correctly size the buffer for a subsequent call.

The BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure includes storage for the first BTH_DEVICE_INFO structure. Use the
    following formula to calculate the correct buffer size for a call to IOCTL_BTH_GET_DEVICE_INFO: 
    <code>
    Buffer=sizeof(BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST)+(NumOfDevices-1)*sizeof(BTH_DEVICE_INFO)</code>.
