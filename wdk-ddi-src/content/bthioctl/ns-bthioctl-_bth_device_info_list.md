# _BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure


## -description


The BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure contains output information about all cached, previously
  discovered remote devices.


## -struct-fields




### -field numOfDevices

The number of devices that have been discovered.


### -field deviceList

An open-ended array of 
     <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=50713">BTH_DEVICE_INFO</a> structures. Each
     structure contains information about a previously discovered remote device.


## -remarks



The 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthioctl/ni-bthioctl-ioctl_bth_get_device_info">IOCTL_BTH_GET_DEVICE_INFO</a> call's
    output buffer contains the list of all cached, previously discovered remote devices.

The 
    <b>numOfDevices</b> member of the BTH_DEVICE_INFO_LIST structure returns the total number of
    BTH_DEVICE_INFO structures available. If the calling driver passes in a smaller buffer, only a portion of
    the available structures will be returned.
