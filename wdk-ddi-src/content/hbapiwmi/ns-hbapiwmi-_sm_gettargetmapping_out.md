# _SM_GetTargetMapping_OUT structure


## -description


The SM_GetTargetMapping structure_OUT structure is used to receive output parameters from the SM_GetTargetMapping method.


## -struct-fields




### -field HBAStatus

The status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/hba-status">HBA_STATUS</a>.


### -field TotalEntryCount

The total number of persistent bindings that are associated with the HBA.


### -field OutEntryCount

The total number of mappings that are retrieved. This value will be less than or equal to TotalEntryCount.


### -field Entry

An array of structures of type SMHBA_SCSIENTRY that describes an HBA's bindings between the operating system and the SAS identifiers.


## -remarks



The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of the SM_GetTargetMapping_OUT structure in <i>Hbapiwmi.h</i> when it compiles the MS_SM_TargetInformationMethods WMI class.
