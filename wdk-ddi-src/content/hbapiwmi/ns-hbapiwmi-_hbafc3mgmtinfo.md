# _HBAFC3MgmtInfo structure


## -description


The HBAFC3MgmtInfo structure is used to report FC3 management information associated with a fibre channel adapter. 


## -struct-fields




### -field UniqueAdapterId

Contains a unique identifier for the adapter. 


### -field wwn

Contains a worldwide name for the adapter, as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification. 


### -field unittype

Describes the type of HBA, as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.


### -field PortId

Contains a value corresponding to the physical port number field of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.


### -field NumberOfAttachedNodes

Contains the number of nodes attached to the topology as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.


### -field IPVersion

Contains the concatenated node management and IP version fields of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.


### -field UDPPort

Indicates the value of the UDP/TCP port number field of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.


### -field IPAddress

Indicates the value of the IP address field of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.


### -field reserved

Reserved.


### -field TopologyDiscoveryFlags

Indicates the value of the vendor specific field in word 12 of the specific identification data as described in the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API </i>specification.


### -field reserved1

Reserved.


## -remarks



FC-3 refers to the common services layer of the fibre channel protocol. It defines a set of services which are common across multiple ports of a node. For an explanation of the common services layer, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification.

The WMI tool suite generates a declaration of this structure automatically when it compiles the <b>HBAFC3MgmtInfo</b> WMI Class in <i>hbaapi.mof</i>.
