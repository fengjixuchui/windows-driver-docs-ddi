# _MS_SMHBA_FC_PHY structure


## -description


The MS_SMHBA_FC_PHY structure is used to report the physical attributes of a fibre channel port.


## -struct-fields




### -field PhySupportSpeed

The signaling bit rates at which the port can operate. For a list of the values that this member supports, see PhySpeed.


### -field PhySpeed
