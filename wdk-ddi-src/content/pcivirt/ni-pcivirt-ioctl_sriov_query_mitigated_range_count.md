## -description


 The request determines the ranges of memory-mapped I/O space that must mitigated.


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pcivirt/ns-pcivirt-_sriov_mitigated_range_count_input">SRIOV_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT_INPUT</a> structure. Set the <b>VfIndex</b> member to 0.


### -input-buffer-length

The size of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pcivirt/ns-pcivirt-_sriov_mitigated_range_count_input">SRIOV_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT_INPUT</a> structure.


### -output-buffer

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pcivirt/ns-pcivirt-_sriov_mitigated_range_count_output">SRIOV_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT_OUTPUT</a> structure that is filled by the physical function (PF) driver with  ranges of memory-mapped I/O space.


### -output-buffer-length

The size of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pcivirt/ns-pcivirt-_sriov_mitigated_range_count_output">SRIOV_MITIGATED_RANGE_COUNT_OUTPUT</a> structure.

### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

TBD

<b>Irp->IoStatus.Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful. Otherwise, <b>Status</b> to the appropriate error condition as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values">NTSTATUS</a> code.


## -remarks



This IOCTL request is sent by the virtualization stack to the  PCI Express SR-IOV Physical Function (PF) driver that exposes GUID_MITIGABLE_DEVICE_INTERFACE.

The virtualization stack uses an I/O MMU to differentiate traffic coming from the various interfaces that the device exposes, enforcing policy about which regions of memory a device can access and which interrupts it can generate.

The request is sent to the physical function (PF) driver by the virtualization stack to find out the ranges of memory-mapped I/O space
in which the stack must place
intercepts  on those pages and send the requests to read and write values
within those pages to the PF driver.
