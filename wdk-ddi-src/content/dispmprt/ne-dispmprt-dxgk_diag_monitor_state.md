# DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_STATE enumeration

## -description

**DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_STATE** specifies the state of the monitors according to the miniport driver, indicating to the operating system (OS) whether the monitors are ready to receive the pixels.

## -enum-fields

### -field DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_STATE_UNINITIALIZED

Reserved for OS use during diagnostic initialization.

### -field DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_READY

The monitor is initialized and setup, and is ready to receive pixels.

### -field DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_NOT_READY

The monitor is not initialized or setup correctly, and is not ready to receive pixels.

### -field DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_READY_NOTAPPLICABLE

The driver doesn't know the current state of the monitor. This value should be used only for monitors for which the driver has no insight into monitor state.

## -remarks

The **DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_STATE** enumeration is a member of the [**DXGK_DISPLAYSTATE_INTRUSIVE**](ns-dispmprt-dxgk_displaystate_intrusive.md) structure. It is used while gathering display diagnostic information via calls to [**DxgkDdiGetDisplayStateIntrusive**](nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_getdisplaystateintrusive.md).

In many situations, the driver needs to initialize the monitor and set it up (typically by sending a command sequence) before it can start sending pixels to the monitor. Additionally, there might be some driver-initiated negotiation/handshaking done with the monitor before pixels can be sent. **DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_STATE** specifies the final state of the monitors according to the miniport driver, indicating to the OS whether the monitors are ready to receive the pixels.

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases (like DisplayPort), **DXGK_DIAG_MONITOR_STATE** might overlap with [**DXGK_DIAG_DISPLAY_LINK_STATE**](ne-dispmprt-dxgk_diag_display_link_state). The purpose of this enumeration is to get the overall current status of the monitor irrespective of the bus/link state.
