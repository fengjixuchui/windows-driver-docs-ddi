# _DXGK_START_INFO structure


## -description


The DXGK_START_INFO structure holds information that is needed by the display miniport driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field RequiredDmaQueueEntry

The number of DMA buffers that the display miniport driver (or the display adapter) must be able to hold in a queue. The display miniport driver must preallocate all resources required to accommodate this number of DMA buffers. 


### -field AdapterGuid

A GUID that will serve as an identifier for the adapter being started.


### -field AdapterLuid

Available starting with WindowsÂ 8.

A locally unique identifier (LUID) that will serve as an identifier for the adapter being started.


## -remarks



The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem submits DMA buffers to the display miniport driver by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_submitcommand">DxgkDdiSubmitCommand</a>.

The <i>DxgkStartInfo</i> parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a> function is a pointer to a DXGK_START_INFO structure.
