# _DXGK_TIMED_OPERATION_INTERFACE structure


## -description


The DXGK_TIMED_OPERATION_INTERFACE structure contains pointers to functions in the Timed Operation Interface, which is implemented by the display port driver.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of this structure.


### -field Version

The version number of the Timed Operation Interface. Version number constants are defined in <i>Dispmprt.h</i> (for example, DXGK_TIMED_OPERATION_INTERFACE_VERSION_1).


### -field Context

A pointer to a context that is provided by the display port driver.


### -field InterfaceReference

A pointer to an interface reference function that is implemented by the display port driver.


### -field InterfaceDereference

A pointer to an interface dereference function that is implemented by the display port driver.


### -field TimedOperationStart

The <b>TimedOperationStart</b> function starts or restarts a timed operation.

The driver should preset the <b>Size</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_timed_operation">DXGK_TIMED_OPERATION</a> structure that is pointed to by the <i>Op</i> parameter to <b>sizeof</b>(DXGK_TIMED_OPERATION).



#### Op

[out] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_timed_operation">DXGK_TIMED_OPERATION</a> structure that describes the timed operation to start or restart.



#### Timeout

[in] A pointer to a time-out value, in 100-nanoseconds units, that specifies the relative time that was allotted for the timed operation to complete. 



#### OsHandled

A Boolean value that specifies whether the operating system handles the time-out condition. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates that the driver does not have any reasonable way to handle the time-out condition and lets the operating system handle the time-out condition; <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the driver handles the time-out condition.


### -field TimedOperationDelay

The <b>TimedOperationDelay</b> function puts the current thread into an alertable or nonalertable wait state for a given interval with regard to the given timed operation time-out.



#### Op

[in/out] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_timed_operation">DXGK_TIMED_OPERATION</a> structure that describes the timed operation to delay. This timed operation was started by a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_timed_operation_interface">TimedOperationStart</a> function.



#### WaitMode

[in] A KPROCESSOR_MODE-typed value that specifies the processor mode the driver waits in. The value can be either <b>KernelMode</b> or <b>UserMode</b>. Lower-level drivers in a stack should specify <b>KernelMode</b>.



#### Alertable

[in] A Boolean value that specifies whether the wait is alertable. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates that the wait is alertable; <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the wait is nonalertable. Lower-level drivers in a stack should specify <b>FALSE</b>.



#### Interval

[in] A pointer to variable that contains the relative time, in 100-nanoseconds units, for the delay. The sign of the value is ignored.


### -field TimedOperationWaitForSingleObject

The <b>TimedOperationWaitForSingleObject</b> function puts the current thread into a wait state until the given dispatcher object is set to a signaled state or optionally until the wait times out or until the time-out of the given timed operation expires.



#### Op

[in] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_timed_operation">DXGK_TIMED_OPERATION</a> structure that describes the timed operation to put into a wait state. This timed operation was started by a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_timed_operation_interface">TimedOperationStart</a> function.



#### Object

A pointer to an initialized dispatcher object that the caller supplies the storage for. The dispatcher object can be an event, a mutex, a semaphore, a thread, or a timer. 



#### WaitReason

A KWAIT_REASON-typed value that specifies the reason for the wait. A driver should set this value to <b>Executive</b> or, if the driver is doing work on behalf of a user and is running in the context of a user thread, to <b>UserRequest</b>.



#### WaitMode

A KPROCESSOR_MODE-typed value that specifies the processor mode the driver waits in. The value can be either <b>KernelMode</b> or <b>UserMode</b>. Lowest-level and intermediate drivers should specify <b>KernelMode</b>. If the object that is pointed to by the <i>Object</i> parameter is a mutex, the caller must specify <b>KernelMode</b>. 



#### Alertable

A Boolean value that specifies whether the wait is alertable. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates that the wait is alertable; <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the wait is nonalertable. 



#### Timeout

A pointer to variable that contains the relative time, in 100-nanoseconds units, for the wait to be completed. The sign of the value is ignored.


## -remarks



The display miniport driver supplies the <b>Size</b> and <b>Version</b> members of this structure, and then calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_query_services">DxgkCbQueryServices</a>, which fills in the remaining members of this structure.
