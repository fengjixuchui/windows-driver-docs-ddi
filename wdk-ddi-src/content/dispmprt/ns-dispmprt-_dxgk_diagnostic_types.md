# _DXGK_DIAGNOSTIC_TYPES structure

## -description

A structure that contains a union of all the defined sets of diagnostic types. The member of the union which should be used to interpret this data is determined by the bit-field which is set in the associated [DXGK_DIAGNOSTIC_CATEGORIES](ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_diagnostic_categories.md) structure.  In general, there will be one set of diagnostic types for each diagnostic category.

## -struct-fields

### -field Notifications

A [DXGK_DIAGTYPE_NOTIFICATIONS](ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_diagtype_notifications.md) structure for indicating what kind of diagnostics are being described.

### -field Progressions

A [DXGK_DIAGTYPE_PROGRESSIONS](../dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_diagtype_progressions.md) structure for indicating a Progressions diagnostic type.

### -field Value

Value of the diagnostic type.

## -remarks

The DXGK_DIAGNOSTIC_TYPES structure is used to identify diagnostic types in different scenarios. \ Depending on the context, zero, one or multiple bits may be set. When reporting a diagnostic, exactly one bit must be set. When controlling diagnostics or querying support, multiple bits may be set and zero bits can be a valid value, for example, when the OS calls [DxgkDdiControlDiagnosticReporting](nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_controldiagnosticreporting.md) to disable all reporting.
