# DXGKCB_WRITE_DEVICE_SPACE callback function


## -description


The <b>DxgkCbWriteDeviceSpace</b> function writes to a device configuration space or the expansion ROM of a display adapter.


## -parameters




### -param DeviceHandle [in]

A handle that represents a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously obtained this handle in the <b>DeviceHandle</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgkrnl_interface">DXGKRNL_INTERFACE</a> structure that was passed to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a>.


### -param DataType [in]

The type of write transaction to be performed. This parameter must be one of the following values, which are defined in <i>Dispmprt.h</i>:





#### DXGK_WHICHSPACE_BRIDGE

Write to the parent bus device's configuration space.



#### DXGK_WHICHSPACE_CONFIG

Write to the display adapter's configuration space.



#### DXGK_WHICHSPACE_MCH

Write to the configuration space of a memory controller hub that is a peer to the adapter's parent bus.



#### DXGK_WHICHSPACE_ROM

Write to the display adapter's expansion ROM.


### -param Buffer [in]

A pointer to a buffer that supplies the data to be written to the configuration space.


### -param Offset [in]

The offset, in bytes, into the configuration space, at which the write transaction begins.


### -param Length [in]

The number of bytes to be written.


### -param BytesWritten [out]

A pointer to a ULONG-typed variable that receives the number of bytes actually written.


## -returns



<b>DxgkCbWriteDeviceSpace</b> returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|STATUS_SUCCESS|The function succeeded.|
|STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER|The DeviceHandle, DataType, or Buffer parameter is invalid.|
|STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL|The function was unable to write the data.|
