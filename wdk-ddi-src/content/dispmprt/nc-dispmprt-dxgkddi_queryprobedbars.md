# DXGKDDI_QUERYPROBEDBARS callback function


## -description

This routine allows a non-privileged virtual machine to find out what would have been read from a Virtual Functionâ€™s Base Address Registers after they had been written with the value (-1).

## -parameters

### -param Context

[in] The miniport context that is returned by the driver in the [DXGKDDI_SRIOV_INTERFACE](ns-dispmprt-_dxgkddi_sriov_interface.md) structure.

### -param pArgs

[in, out] Pointer to the DXGKARG_QUERYPROBEDBARS structure.

## -prototype

```
//Declaration

DXGKDDI_QUERYPROBEDBARS DxgkddiQueryprobedbars; 

// Definition

VOID DxgkddiQueryprobedbars 
(
	HANDLE Context
	DXGKARG_QUERYPROBEDBARS * pArgs
)
{...}

```

## -remarks

This is part of the normal process of setting up a PCI device, and the result allows the PCI driver to know how much address space would be decoded by the device after it was enabled. Because writing -1 to the physical BARS could be considered a security risk, this step of PCI enumeration is emulated.
