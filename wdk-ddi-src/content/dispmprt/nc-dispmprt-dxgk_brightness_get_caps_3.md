# DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_CAPS_3 callback function

## -description

Implemented by the client driver to retrieve the brightness control capabilities of an integrated display panel.

## -prototype

```cpp
//Declaration

DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_CAPS_3 DxgkBrightnessGetCaps3;

// Definition

NTSTATUS DxgkBrightnessGetCaps3
(
	PVOID Context
	ULONG ChildUid
	DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_CAPS *pBrightnessCaps
)
{...}

DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_CAPS_3


```

## -parameters

### -param Context

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter.

### -param ChildUid

[in] An integer that uniquely identifies the child device. The display miniport driver's [DxgkDdiQueryChildRelations](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_query_child_relations.md) function previously provided this identifier to the display port driver.

### -param pBrightnessCaps:

[out] Pointer to a [DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_CAPS](../d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_brightness_caps.md) structure that represents the brightness control capabilities of the display panel.

## -returns

Return STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, return an appropriate NTSTATUS Values error code defined in ntstatus.h.

## -remarks

Any device supporting the Brightness3 interface must support transition times, so SmoothBrightness is no longer used.

The NitsBrightness bit has been introduced to represent support for calibrated nit-based brightness. If the device does not support nit-based brightness, brightness levels will still be represented in millinits, but the operating system will be aware that they donâ€™t map to known absolute brightness levels.
