# _DXGK_DEVICE_INFO structure


## -description


The DXGK_DEVICE_INFO structure holds information that describes a display adapter.


## -struct-fields




### -field MiniportDeviceContext

A handle to a context block (created and maintained by the display miniport driver) associated with a display adapter.


### -field PhysicalDeviceObject

A pointer to the physical device object (PDO) that represents the display adapter.


### -field DeviceRegistryPath

A Unicode string that holds the registry path of the software key for the display adapter. Registry data should be written only to this path.


### -field TranslatedResourceList

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_cm_resource_list">CM_RESOURCE_LIST</a> structure that holds the translated resources assigned to the display adapter.


### -field SystemMemorySize

The size, in bytes, of system memory.


### -field HighestPhysicalAddress

The highest physical address of system memory (RAM).


### -field AgpApertureBase

The base physical address of the AGP aperture. If 0, the display adapter is not an AGP adapter, or AGP resources were not found.


### -field AgpApertureSize

The size, in bytes, of the AGP aperture. If 0, the display adapter is not an AGP adapter, or AGP resources were not found.


### -field DockingState

The state of a portable computer that can be attached to a docking station.


## -remarks



The display miniport driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device">DxgkDdiStartDevice</a> function allocates a DXGK_DEVICE_INFO structure and calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_get_device_information">DxgkCbGetDeviceInformation</a> to get that structure filled in with information about a display adapter. Five of the structure members (<b>Version</b>, <b>SystemMemorySize</b>, <b>HighestPhysicalAddress</b>, <b>AgpApertureBase</b>, and <b>AgpApertureSize</b>) hold general information and are not associated with a particular display adapter. Those members are included in the DXGK_DEVICE_INFO structure because they provide information that <i>DxgkDdiStartDevice</i> requires to initialize the driver and display adapter hardware.
