## -prototype

```cpp
//Declaration

DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_3 DxgkBrightnessGet3;

// Definition

NTSTATUS DxgkBrightnessGet3
(
	PVOID Context
	ULONG ChildUid
	PDXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_OUT pOut
)
{...}

DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_3


```

## -parameters

### -param Context

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter.

### -param ChildUid

[in] An integer that uniquely identifies the child device. The display miniport driver's [DxgkDdiQueryChildRelations](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_query_child_relations.md) function previously provided this identifier to the display port driver.

### -param pOut

[out] Pointer to a [PDXGK_BRIGHTNESS_GET_OUT](../d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_brightness_get_out.md) structure that contains the output parameters for the get brightness call.


## -returns

Return STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, return an appropriate NTSTATUS Values error code defined in ntstatus.h.
