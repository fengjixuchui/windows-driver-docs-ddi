# IOCTL_SMARTCARD_IS_PRESENT IOCTL


## -description


The <b>IOCTL_SMARTCARD_IS_PRESENT</b> 
   control code detects whether a smart card is currently detected. If a card is present, it returns immediately with STATUS_SUCCESS. If no smart card is detected, it subscribes to the smart card arrival event and is kept pending. Closing the file handle unsubscribes the event. 


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

None.


### -input-buffer-length








### -output-buffer

None.


### -output-buffer-length








### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

<b>Irp->IoStatus.Status</b> is set to <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> if the request is successful. Possible error codes are:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return Code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_PENDING</td>
<td>This code is returned if the operation is waiting for the smart card to approach into the radio field.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_DEVICE_BUSY</td>
<td>This code is returned if the operation is already waiting for the present event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE</td>
<td>This code is returned if the device cannot accept the request.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</td>
<td>This code is returned when the input or output buffers are invalid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_DEVICE_POWERED_OFF</td>
<td>This code is returned when the proximity radio control is off.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


## -remarks



The following actions are required when using this IOCTL:<ul>
<li>

The driver must support CancelIo on this pended IOCTL.

</li>
<li>It is a power-managed request. The pended IOCTL will keep the driver in a D0 power state.</li>
<li>The driver must return STATUS_SUCCESS only for the supported type.</li>
</ul>
