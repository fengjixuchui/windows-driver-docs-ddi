## -enum-fields




### -field PmiCapabilitiesChangedEvent

The event was caused by a change in the PMI capabilities of the power meter.


### -field PmiThresholdEvent

The event was caused because the power level exceeded a configured threshold of the power meter.


### -field PmiConfigurationChangedEvent

The event was caused by a change in the PMI configuration of the power meter.


### -field PmiBudgetEvent

The event was caused because the power budget exceeded or fell below the configured budget of the power meter.


### -field PmiAveragingIntervalChangedEvent

The event was caused because the interval, during which the power meter averages power measurement data, was changed.


### -field PmiEventMax

The maximum number of PMI event types.


## -remarks



The <b>EventType</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pmi/ns-pmi-_pmi_event">PMI_EVENT</a> structure contains information about the type of PMI event data that is referenced by the <b>Event</b> member of that structure. This structure is returned through a successful completion of an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pmi/ni-pmi-ioctl_pmi_register_event_notify">IOCTL_PMI_REGISTER_EVENT_NOTIFY</a> request.
