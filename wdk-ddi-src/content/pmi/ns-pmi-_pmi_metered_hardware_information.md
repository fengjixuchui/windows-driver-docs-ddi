# _PMI_METERED_HARDWARE_INFORMATION structure


## -description


The PMI_METERED_HARDWARE_INFORMATION structure contains information about one or more power supplies that are monitored by the power meter.


## -struct-fields




### -field MeteredHardwareCount

A value that specifies the number of device identifiers that are returned in the <b>MeteredHardware</b> member.


### -field MeteredHardware

A Unicode string that specifies the name of each device that is powered by the circuit on which the power meter provides measurement data. Individual device paths are delimited by a <b>NULL</b> character, and the whole list is terminated with a double <b>NULL</b>. The format of the device name is \\Device\xyz". 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  For systemwide power meters, this member returns <b>NULL</b>.</div>
<div> </div>

## -remarks



The PMI_METERED_HARDWARE_INFORMATION structure is returned through an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pmi/ni-pmi-ioctl_pmi_get_capabilities">IOCTL_PMI_GET_CAPABILITIES</a> I/O control (IOCTL) query request. The input data for this query request is set to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pmi/ne-pmi-pmi_capabilities_type">PMI_CAPABILITIES_TYPE</a> enumerator value of <b>PmiMeteredHardware</b>.

If the query request completes successfully, the request returns a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pmi/ns-pmi-_pmi_capabilities">PMI_CAPABILITIES</a> structure. The <b>Capabilities</b> member of this structure is formatted as a PMI_METERED_HARDWARE_INFORMATION structure.
