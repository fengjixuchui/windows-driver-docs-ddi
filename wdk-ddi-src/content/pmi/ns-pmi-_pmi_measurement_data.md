# _PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure


## -description


The PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure contains the current power measurement that is collected by a power meter.


## -struct-fields




### -field Version

A value that specifies the version of this structure. For Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and later versions of Windows, this value must be 1.


### -field CurrentPower

A value, in units of milliwatts (mW), that specifies the current power meter measurement.


## -remarks



The PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure is returned through an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pmi/ni-pmi-ioctl_pmi_get_measurement">IOCTL_PMI_GET_MEASUREMENT</a> I/O control (IOCTL) query request. If the query request completes successfully, the request returns a PMI_MEASUREMENT_DATA structure.
