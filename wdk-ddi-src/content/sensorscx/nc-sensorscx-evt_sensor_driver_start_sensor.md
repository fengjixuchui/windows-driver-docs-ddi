# EVT_SENSOR_DRIVER_START_SENSOR callback function


## -description


This callback function starts the sensor based on the default properties specified by the driver, or properties set by the class extension.


## -parameters




### -param Sensor

A reference to a sensor object.


## -returns



This function returns STATUS_SUCCESS when completed successfully.

<b>Note</b> The class extension (CX) only uses the NT_SUCCESS macro to determine if the call to the driverâ€™s Evt function was successful, but does not take any action if the function failed or does not return STATUS_SUCCESS.




## -remarks



This function must be implemented by the driver and is called only once by the class extension.
