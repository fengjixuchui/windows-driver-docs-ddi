# EVT_SENSOR_DRIVER_SET_BATCH_LATENCY callback function


## -description

This callback function sets the batch latency for a specified sensor.

## -parameters

### -param Sensor

[in] A reference to a sensor object.

### -param BatchLatencyMs

[in] The batch latency, expressed in milliseconds.

## -returns

This function returns STATUS_SUCCESS when completed successfully.

<b>Note</b> The class extension (CX) only uses the NT_SUCCESS macro to determine if the call to the driverâ€™s Evt function was successful, but does not take any action if the function failed or does not return STATUS_SUCCESS.

## -remarks

The driver can set the batch latency to a value that is less than or equal to <i>BatchLatencyMs</i>, depending on buffer availability. For information about the sensor properties that a data batching sensor driver must report, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/sensors/common-sensor-properties">Common sensor properties</a>.

It is important to note that there is no change implied to sensor data delivery methods and events, due to data batching.  When data batching latency expires, the driver will call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorscx/nf-sensorscx-sensorscxsensordataready">SensorsCxSensorDataReady</a> repeatedly to deliver all the buffered data samples, one at a time. The data samples are sent, along with the timestamp information in their <b>PKEY_SensorData_Timestamp</b>  data fields. The timestamp information (of data type VT_FILETIME) shows the time  at which a sample was taken.

For more information about the VT_FILETIME data type, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=313395">MSDN PROPVARIANT structure</a>.
