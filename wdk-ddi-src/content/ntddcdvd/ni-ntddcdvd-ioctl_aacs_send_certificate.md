# IOCTL_AACS_SEND_CERTIFICATE IOCTL


## -description


Sends the host certificate to the logical unit. 


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains host certificate of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddcdvd/ns-ntddcdvd-_aacs_send_certificate">AACS_SEND_CERTIFICATE</a>.

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be >= <b>sizeof</b>(AACS_SEND_CERTIFICATE). 


### -input-buffer-length

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer, which must be >= <b>sizeof</b>(AACS_SEND_CERTIFICATE). 


### -output-buffer

None.


### -output-buffer-length

None.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

The <b>Information</b> field is set to the number of bytes transferred. The <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS or possibly STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES.


## -remarks



The IOCTL_AACS_SEND_CERTIFICATE request corresponds to the step in the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) authentication algorithm (AACS-Auth) in which the host sends its certificate and nonce to the drive. For a complete description of AACS-Auth, see the <i>Advanced Access Content System, Introduction and Common Cryptographic Elements</i> specification that is published by Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator (AACS LA).
