# _INDICATION_CODE enumeration


## -description

The INDICATION_CODE enumeration type indicates to a profile driver what type of L2CAP event has
  occurred.

## -enum-fields

### -field IndicationAddReference

Indicates to a profile driver to add a reference to its device object because it may be called at
     any time.

### -field IndicationReleaseReference

Indicates to a profile driver to release a reference to its device object and that it will no
     longer be called.

### -field IndicationRemoteConnect

Indicates to a server profile driver that a remote device is connecting to the PSM that the
     profile driver registered earlier. Profile drivers accept or reject this request by 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff536657(v=vs.85)">building and sending</a> a 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff536616(v=vs.85)">
     BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</a> request. When this indication code is passed, the profile driver
     should use the parameters that are passed to it in the 
     <b>Connect</b> member of the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/ns-bthddi-_indication_parameters">
     INDICATION_PARAMETERS</a> structure.

### -field IndicationRemoteDisconnect

Indicates to a registered profile driver that a remote device disconnecting from the local radio.
     When this indication code is passed, the profile driver should use the parameters that are passed to it
     in the 
     <b>Disconnect</b> member of the INDICATION_PARAMETERS structure.

### -field IndicationRemoteConfigRequest

Indicates to a client profile driver that a remote device is performing a configuration request.
     When this indication code is passed, the profile driver should use the parameters that are passed to it
     in the 
     <b>ConfigRequest</b> member of the INDICATION_PARAMETERS structure.

### -field IndicationRemoteConfigResponse

Indicates to a client profile driver that a remote device is responding to a configuration
     request. When this indication code is passed, the profile driver should use the parameters that are
     passed to it in the 
     <b>ConfigResponse</b> member of the INDICATION_PARAMETERS structure.

### -field IndicationFreeExtraOptions

Reserved for future use. Do not use.

### -field IndicationRecvPacket

Indicates to a registered profile driver that a packet has been received on the specified PSM. The
     profile driver can use this event to determine when it is necessary to issue a read
     BRB_L2CA_ACL_TRANSFTER BRB. Profile drivers that need to read from the remote device can also ignore
     this notification and keep a read BRB pending at all times. When this indication code is passed, the
     profile driver should use the parameters that are passed to it in the 
     <b>RecvPacket</b> member of the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/ns-bthddi-_indication_parameters">
     INDICATION_PARAMETERS</a> structure.

### -field IndicationPairDevice

Indicates to a registered driver that the local radio has bonded to a specific remote
     radio.

### -field IndicationUnpairDevice

Indicates to a registered driver that the local radio is no longer bonded to a specific remote
     radio.

### -field IndicationUnpersonalizeDevice

Indicates to a registered driver that the specified remote radio has been removed from the list of
     personal devices.

### -field IndicationRemoteConnectLE

Indicates to a server profile driver that a low energy (LE) remote device is connecting to the PSM that the
     profile driver registered earlier. Profile drivers accept or reject this request by 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff536657(v=vs.85)">building and sending</a> a 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff536616(v=vs.85)">
     BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</a> request. When this indication code is passed, the profile driver
     should use the parameters that are passed to it in the 
     <b>Connect</b> member of the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/ns-bthddi-_indication_parameters">
     INDICATION_PARAMETERS</a> structure. This value is present in WindowsÂ 8 and later versions of Windows.

## -remarks

A value from this enumeration is passed to a profile driver's 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/nc-bthddi-pfnbthport_indication_callback">L2CAP Callback Function</a> to notify
    it of an event.
