# _BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL structure


## -description

The _BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL structure describes a currently open SCO channel to close.

## -struct-fields

### -field Hdr

A 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/ns-bthddi-_brb_header">BRB_HEADER</a> structure that contains information
     about the current BRB.

### -field BtAddress

The Bluetooth address of the remote device.

### -field ChannelHandle

The handle to the SCO channel to close.

## -remarks

To close a SCO channel, profile drivers should 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff536657(v=vs.85)">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff536622(v=vs.85)">BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL</a> request.

A <b>BRB_SCO_CLOSE_CHANNEL</b> request can be made for a channel that was initiated locally or remotely. If a
    profile driver has multiple SCO connections to a single remote device, it must close each one
    individually.
