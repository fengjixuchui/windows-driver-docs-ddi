# _L2CAP_DISCONNECT_REASON enumeration


## -description

The L2CAP_DISCONNECT_REASON enumeration type gives the reason an L2CAP channel has been
  disconnected.

## -enum-fields

### -field HciDisconnect

The value specifies for the profile driver that the Bluetooth driver stack has received a
     disconnect notification from the host controller interface (HCI) layer.

### -field L2capDisconnectRequest

This value specifies for the profile driver that a disconnect request has been received from a
     remote device.

### -field RadioPoweredDown

This value specifies for the profile driver that the local radio has been turned off.

### -field HardwareRemoval

This value specifies for the profile driver that the local radio has been physically
     removed.

## -remarks

A value from this enumeration is used as the 
    <b>Reason</b> member of the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/ns-bthddi-_indication_parameters">INDICATION_PARAMETERS</a> structure.

Hardware limitations may prevent the Bluetooth driver stack from distinguishing between 
    <b>RadioPoweredDown</b> and 
    <b>HardwareRemoval</b> events.

Currently, 
    <i>HciDisconnect</i> and 
    <i>L2capDisconnectRequest</i> are the only values the Bluetooth driver stack passes to the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/nc-bthddi-pfnbthport_indication_callback">L2CAP Callback Function</a>.
