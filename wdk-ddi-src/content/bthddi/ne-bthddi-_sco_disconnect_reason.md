# _SCO_DISCONNECT_REASON enumeration


## -description


The SCO_DISCONNECT_REASON enumeration type gives the reason an SCO channel has been
  disconnected.


## -enum-fields




### -field ScoHciDisconnect

This value specifies to the profile driver that the Bluetooth driver stack has received a
     disconnect notification from the host controller interface (HCI) layer.


### -field ScoDisconnectRequest

This value specifies to the profile driver that a disconnect request has been received from the
     remote device.


### -field ScoRadioPoweredDown

This value specifies to the profile driver that the local radio has been turned off.


### -field ScoHardwareRemoval

This value specifies to the profile driver that the local radio has been physically
     removed.


## -remarks



A value from this enumeration is used as the 
    <b>Reason</b> member of the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/bthddi/ns-bthddi-_sco_indication_parameters">
    SCO_INDICATION_PARAMETERS</a> structure.

Hardware limitations may prevent the Bluetooth driver stack from distinguishing between 
    <b>ScoRadioPoweredDown</b> and 
    <b>ScoHardwareRemoval</b> events.

Currently, 
    <i>ScoHciDisconnect</i> is the only value the Bluetooth driver stack passes to the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/bthddi/nc-bthddi-pfnsco_indication_callback">SCO Callback Function</a>.
