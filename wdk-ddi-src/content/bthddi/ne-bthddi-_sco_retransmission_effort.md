# _SCO_RETRANSMISSION_EFFORT enumeration


## -description


The SCO_RETRANSMISSION_EFFORT enumeration type is used to determine the retransmission policies of a
  SCO channel.


## -enum-fields




### -field SCO_RETRANSMISSION_NONE

The profile driver specifies that there should be no retransmissions on the channel.


### -field SCO_RETRANSMISSION_MIN1_POWER

The profile driver specifies that there should be at least one retransmission on the channel. Any
     retransmissions that are performed should be optimized for power consumption.


### -field SCO_RETRANSMISSION_MIN1_QUALITY

The profile driver specifies that there should be at least one retransmission on the channel. Any
     retransmissions that are performed should be optimized for link quality.


### -field SCO_RETRANSMISSION_DONT_CARE

The profile driver specifies that retransmissions can occur, but are not required.
