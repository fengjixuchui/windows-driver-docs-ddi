## -remarks

To open a L2CAP channel, profile drivers should 
    <a href="/previous-versions/ff536657(v=vs.85)">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="/previous-versions/ff536615(v=vs.85)">BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL</a> request.

Profile drivers that act as clients specify a destination address, a PSM, and a variety of
    configuration parameters.

If the <b>BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL</b> request completes successfully, a variety of information about the newly
    created connection is available in the 
    <b>OutResults</b> and 
    <b>InResults</b> members. 
    <b>OutResults</b> specifies the parameters for the outbound half of the channel, and 
    <b>InResults</b> specifies the parameters for the inbound half of the channel.

Several of the configuration parameters passed in this structure, such as the 
    <b>Mtu</b> member, are ranges used for negotiation with the remote radio. Clients should provide as wide a
    range as possible to increase the chances of successful channel negotiation. Specifying a minimum MTU
    size greater than the basic Bluetooth minimum MTU size should only be done when absolutely necessary. If
    negotiation fails, the connection will fail.

Profile drivers must allocate the memory to store the array that is stored in the 
    <b>ExtraOptions</b> member and should not free this memory until the callback function defined in the 
    <b>Callback</b> member returns with an 
    <b>IndicationFreeExtraOptions</b> notification 
    <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/ne-bthddi-_indication_code">INDICATION_CODE</a> value passed in its 
    <i>Indication</i> parameter.

The 
    <b>IncomingQueueDepth</b> member of the _BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL structure specifies the maximum number of
    MTUs that the Bluetooth driver stack will receive and queue on the connection before it begins to discard
    them. Setting this value to a very small number increases the chances of data loss, while setting it to a
    very large number can increase memory usage. Setting this member to 10 is an effective compromise.

To accept or reject an incoming L2CAP connection request initiated by a remote device, profile drivers
    should 
    <a href="/previous-versions/ff536657(v=vs.85)">build and send</a> a 
    <a href="/previous-versions/ff536616(v=vs.85)">
    BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</a> request.

A profile driver should build and send a <b>BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</b> request when the Bluetooth
    driver stack calls the profile driver's 
    <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthddi/nc-bthddi-pfnbthport_indication_callback">L2CAP Callback Function</a> and passes 
    <b>IndicationRemoteConnect</b> in the callback function's 
    <i>Indication</i> parameter.

Based on the value of the 
    <b>Response</b> member of this structure, the Bluetooth driver stack will then accept or reject the
    connection request.

The profile driver specifies whether the connection should be accepted by storing an appropriate value
    in the 
    <b>Response</b> member of this structure.

Upon receiving the CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_PENDING response, the connecting client should reset its
    connection timer and wait for an updated connection response message. Profile drivers calling the
    <b>BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</b> BRB where the 
    <b>Response</b> member is set to CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_PENDING should promptly issue an additional
    <b>BRB_L2CA_OPEN_CHANNEL_RESPONSE</b> BRB with an updated connection value. The updated value can be any of the
    status codes described in the 
    <b>Response</b> member, including resending a CONNECT_RSP_RESULT_PENDING value.

Profile drivers must allocate the memory to store the array that is stored in the 
    <b>ExtraOptions</b> member and should not free this memory until the callback function that is defined in
    the 
    <b>Callback</b> member returns with an 
    <b>IndicationFreeExtraOptions</b> notification 
    <b>INDICATION_CODE</b> value passed in its 
    <i>Indication</i> parameter.
