## -remarks

Profile drivers can use CM_BASIC | CM_RETRANSMISSION_AND_FLOW, or CM_BASIC | CM_STREAMING modes for the <b>Flags</b> member. This indicates to open an enhanced retransmission mode, or streaming mode channel if possible, and if not fall back to basic mode channel. 
A value of CM_RETRANSMISSION_AND_FLOW | CM_STREAMING is not supported.
