# _BRIGHTNESS_NIT_RANGE structure

## -description

A linear range of supported millinit levels.

## -struct-fields

### -field MinLevelInMillinit

Lowest level in this range. Calibrated data provided to the Display Driver by OEMs should be taken with an On Pixel Ratio (OPR) percentage of 100% where each pixel is set to an RGB value of (255, 255, 255) or floating point equivalent.

### -field MaxLevelInMillinit

Highest level in this range. Can be equal to MinimumLevelInMillinit to represent a range with just one level. For example, this could support a display with just one boost level.  Calibrated data provided to the Display Driver by OEMs should be taken with an On Pixel Ratio (OPR) percentage of 100% where each pixel is set to an RGB value of (255, 255, 255) or floating point equivalent.

### -field StepSizeInMillinit

The size of steps between valid brightness levels in the range. Minimum + StepSize * n is considered a valid level for non-negative n, where the level is equal to or below maximum. (Maximum â€“ Minimum) % StepSize should always be zero. If MinimumLevelInMillinit == MaximumLevelInMillinit, then this should be zero.
