# _WSK_BUF structure


## -description


The WSK_BUF structure defines a data buffer that is used for sending and receiving data over a
  socket.


## -struct-fields




### -field Mdl

A pointer to a memory descriptor list (MDL). The MDL can be a single MDL or the first MDL in an
     MDL chain. If the 
     <b>Length</b> member is zero, this pointer can be <b>NULL</b>.


### -field Offset

An offset to where the data starts in the MDL. If the 
     <b>Mdl</b> member points to the first MDL in an MDL chain, this offset must be within the memory buffer
     that is described by the first MDL in the chain. If the 
     <b>Mdl</b> member is <b>NULL</b>, the 
     <b>Offset</b> member is not used.


### -field Length

When a WSK_BUF structure is used to describe a buffer of data to be sent over a socket, this
     member specifies the number of bytes of data in the MDL (or MDL chain) to be sent.
     

When a WSK_BUF structure is used to describe a buffer for receiving data from a socket, this member
     specifies the maximum number of bytes to be received into the MDL (or MDL chain).

When a WSK_BUF structure is contained within either a 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wsk/ns-wsk-_wsk_data_indication">WSK_DATA_INDICATION</a> structure or a 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wsk/ns-wsk-_wsk_datagram_indication">WSK_DATAGRAM_INDICATION</a> structure,
     this member specifies the number of bytes of received data in the MDL (or MDL chain).


## -remarks



Each MDL in the MDL chain that is pointed to by the 
    <b>Mdl</b> member describes memory that is either locked or from non-paged pool.

When a WSK application passes a pointer to a WSK_BUF structure to the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wsk/nc-wsk-pfn_wsk_receive">WskReceive</a> function, the application can
    specify zero for the 
    <b>Length</b> member of the structure. In that situation, the 
    <b>Mdl</b> member can be <b>NULL</b> because no data will be copied into the buffer.
