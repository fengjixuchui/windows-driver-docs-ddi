# DXGI_DDI_ARG_BLT_FLAGS structure


## -description

The DXGI_DDI_ARG_BLT_FLAGS structure identifies the type of bit-block transfer (bitblt) to perform.

## -struct-fields

### -field Resolve

A UINT value that specifies that the bitblt resolves multiple samples to one pixel. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).

### -field Convert

A UINT value that specifies that the bitblt also performs a format conversion.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).

### -field Stretch

A UINT value that specifies that a stretching bitblt is performed.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).

### -field Present

A UINT value that specifies that a presenting bitblt is performed.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 28 bits (0xFFFFFFF0) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.

### -field Value

A member in the union that DXGI_DDI_ARG_BLT_FLAGS contains that can hold a 32-bit value that identifies the bitblt type.
