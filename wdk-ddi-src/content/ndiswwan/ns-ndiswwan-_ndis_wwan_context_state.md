# _NDIS_WWAN_CONTEXT_STATE structure


## -description


The NDIS_WWAN_CONTEXT_STATE structure represents the Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context state of the
  MB device.


## -struct-fields




### -field Header

The header with type, revision, and size information about the NDIS_WWAN_CONTEXT_STATE structure.
     The MB Service sets the header with the values that are shown in the following table when it sends the
     data structure to the miniport driver for 
     <i>set</i> operations. Miniport drivers must set the header with the same values when they send the data
     structure to the MB service.
     

<table>
<tr>
<th>Header submember</th>
<th>Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Type

</td>
<td>
NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Revision

</td>
<td>
Windows 8 miniport drivers should set this to NDIS_WWAN_CONTEXT_STATE_REVISION_2. Windows 7 miniport drivers should set this to NDIS_WWAN_CONTEXT_STATE_REVISION_1.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Size

</td>
<td>
sizeof(NDIS_WWAN_CONTEXT_STATE)

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

For more information about these members, see 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.


### -field uStatus

The status of context activation or deactivation operation. The following table shows the possible
     values for this member.
     

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
Context activation or deactivation succeeded.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_FAILURE

</td>
<td>
The operation failed. Miniport drivers can return this value if the context has already been
        activated.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_PIN_REQUIRED

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the device requires a PIN.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_BAD_SIM

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because a bad SIM card was detected.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_SIM_NOT_INSERTED

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the SIM card was not inserted fully into the device.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the device is in the process of initializing. Retry the operation
        after the ready-state of the device changes to 
        <b>WwanReadyStateInitialized</b>.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

Miniport drivers can return the following error codes (in addition to those previously described)
     only in the event of a failed set PDP activation operation.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_RADIO_POWER_OFF

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the radio is currently turned off. This error code should be returned
        only in response to a OID_WWAN_CONNECT 
        <i>set</i> request. If the radio state is off then the miniport driver should respond to
        OID_WWAN_CONNECT 
        <i>query</i> requests with WWAN_STATUS_SUCCESS and specify the current context state as 
        <b>WwanActivationStateDeactivated</b>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_SERVICE_NOT_ACTIVATED

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because either the subscription has expired, or the device does not allow PDP
        activation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_PROVIDER_NOT_VISIBLE

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the service provider is not currently visible.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_MAX_ACTIVATED_CONTEXTS

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the maximum number of activated contexts has been reached.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_INVALID_ACCESS_STRING

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the access string is invalid.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_INVALID_USER_NAME_PWD

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the user name and/or password supplied are invalid. Network specific
        error code may be available in 
        <b>uNwError</b> .

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_PACKET_SVC_DETACHED

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because packet service is detached.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_NOT_REGISTERED

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the device is not in the registered state to perform PDP
        activation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_VOICE_CALL_IN_PROGRESS

</td>
<td>
The operation failed and cannot proceed with PDP activation because a voice call is currently in
        progress. This value applies only to devices with voice class is set to 
        <b>WwanVoiceClassSeparateVoiceData</b>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_STATUS_CONTEXT_NOT_ACTIVATED

</td>
<td>
The operation failed because the context identified by 
        <b>ConnectionId</b> is not the currently activated context.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

A formatted 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_context_state">WWAN_CONTEXT_STATE</a> object that
