# IOCTL_GPIO_WRITE_PINS IOCTL


## -description


The <b>IOCTL_GPIO_WRITE_PINS</b> I/O control code enables a client of the general-purpose I/O (GPIO) controller to write to a set of GPIO pins that are configured as outputs. Typically, the clients of a GPIO controller are drivers for peripheral devices that connect to GPIO pins.


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The input buffer.


### -input-buffer-length

The input buffer should be large enough to contain data for all of the GPIO pins that are part of the target connection to which the client sends the request. For example, if the GPIO controller hardware implements 64 GPIO pins, and the client opens a connection to three of these GPIO pins, a one-byte buffer is sufficiently large to contain the three 1-bit values to write to the three pins in the connection.


### -output-buffer

The output buffer contains the same data as the input buffer (because the <i>TransferType</i> for this IOCTL is METHOD_BUFFERED).


### -output-buffer-length

Same as the input buffer.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

If the operation is successful, the controller driver sets the <b>Status</b> member to STATUS_SUCCESS, and sets the <b>Information</b> member to the total number of bytes transferred during the requested operation. If the operation transfers N bits, the number of bytes transferred is (N + 7) / 8. (That is, 7 is added to N to round up to the next byte boundary before the integer division by 8.)

If this request fails, the <b>Status</b> member is set to an error code and no data is read from the GPIO pins. The requested operation might fail for various reasons, which can include invalid client input, low resources, and device malfunction.

If the input buffer is not large enough to contain one bit of data for each GPIO pin in the target connection, the <b>Status</b> member is set to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL. If the GPIO pins in the target connection are configured as inputs, the <b>Status</b> member is set to STATUS_GPIO_OPERATION_DENIED.


## -remarks



This request writes to all of the GPIO pins that are part of the target connection to which the client sends the request. For example, if the connection has three pins, bits 0, 1, and 2 from the input buffer are written to these three pins. The three pins in this example connection might map to GPIO pins 7, 8, and 23 in the GPIO controller hardware. If so, bit 0 (the least significant bit) in the buffer is written to GPIO pin 7, bit 1 in the buffer is written to GPIO pin 8, and bit 2 in the buffer is written to GPIO pin 23.

When the client opens a connection to a target GPIO device, all of the GPIO pins in this connection are configured either as inputs or as outputs. An <b>IOCTL_GPIO_WRITE_PINS</b> request can succeed only if the target pins are outputs.

The client sends this I/O control request to the file object for the target device. The file object is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_file_object">FILE_OBJECT</a> structure that represents a logical connection to the target. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/download/dn550976(v=vs.85)">Kernel-mode driver framework</a> (KMDF) drivers call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfiotarget/nf-wdfiotarget-wdfiotargetcreate">WdfIoTargetCreate</a> method to open this connection. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/overview-of-the-umdf">User-mode driver framework</a> (UMDF) drivers call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfremotetarget-openfilebyname">IWDFRemoteTarget::OpenFileByName</a> method to open the connection.
