# PAGP_FREE_PHYSICAL callback function


## -description


The <b>AgpFreePhysical</b> function frees system memory that was committed by a previous call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/videoagp/nc-videoagp-pagp_commit_physical">AgpCommitPhysical</a>.


## -parameters




### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the device extension of the miniport driver.


### -param PhysicalReserveContext [in]

Identifies a reserved physical address range. This context handle was obtained from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/videoagp/nc-videoagp-pagp_reserve_physical">AgpReservePhysical</a>.


### -param Pages [in]

Specifies the number of pages of system memory that the video port driver should unmap.


### -param Offset [in]

Specifies the page offset into the reserved physical address range identified by <b>PhysicalReserveContext</b> that indicates the actual base address at which to unmap system memory.


## -remarks



When a miniport driver calls <b>AgpFreePhysical</b>, <b>Pages</b> pages of physical memory are unlocked and unmapped from the AGP-decodable physical address range. This range begins <b>Offset</b> pages into the range identified by <b>PhysicalReserveContext</b>. The miniport driver must specify that the exact offset and number of pages be freed as were committed in a prior call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/videoagp/nc-videoagp-pagp_commit_physical">AgpCommitPhysical</a>.
