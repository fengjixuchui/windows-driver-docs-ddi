# _MPIO_DSM_Path_V2 structure


## -description


The MPIO_DSM_Path_V2 structure is used to represent the DSM's definition of a path. It is a superset of the previously existing MPIO_DSM_Path class.


## -struct-fields




### -field DsmPathId

An unsigned 64-bitfield that is used as a unique identifier to distinguish paths known to the DSM.


### -field Reserved

Should be zero.


### -field PathWeight

An unsigned 32-bitfield that holds the weight associated with the given path.


### -field PrimaryPath

An unsigned 32-bitfield that is used as a flag to indicate the path state when accessing a particular LUN.


### -field OptimizedPath

An unsigned 32-bitfield that is used in conjunction with <i>PrimaryPath</i> to indicate the path state for accessing a LUN.


### -field PreferredPath

An unsigned 32-bitfield that is used as a flag to indicate whether this is the preferred path for accessing the LUN.


### -field FailedPath

A 32-bit unsigned field that is used as a flag to indicate if the path has failed.


### -field TargetPortGroup_State

An unsigned 32-bitfield that is used to indicate the access state of the target port group to which this instance of the LUN belongs.


### -field ALUASupport

An unsigned 32-bitfield that returns the Asymmetrical Logical Unit Access (ALUA) state transition support that is indicated by the LUN.


### -field SymmetricLUA

An unsigned 8-bitfield that is used as a flag to indicate to the application if logical unit access is symmetric.


### -field TargetPortGroup_Preferred

An unsigned 8-bitfield that is used as a flag. This field indicates if the LUN's target port group that corresponds to this path is preferred for the LUN access.


### -field TargetPortGroup_Identifier

An unsigned 16-bitfield that contains the identifier of the LUN's target port group that corresponds to this path.


### -field TargetPort_Identifier

An unsigned 32-bitfield that contains the identifier of the target port that corresponds to this path through which the LUN has been exposed.


### -field Reserved32

Should be zero.


### -field Reserved64

Should be zero.
