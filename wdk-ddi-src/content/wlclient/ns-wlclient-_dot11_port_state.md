# _DOT11_PORT_STATE structure


## -description


<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/wireless/ff560689(v=vs.85)">Native 802.11 Wireless LAN</a> interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/wifi-universal-driver-model">WLAN Universal Windows driver model</a>.</div><div> </div>The DOT11_PORT_STATE structure defines the port state for a security session with a peer within a
  basic service set (BSS) network. The peer could either be an access point (AP) within an infrastructure BSS
  network, or a peer station within an independent BSS (IBSS) network.


## -syntax


```cpp
typedef struct _DOT11_PORT_STATE {
  DOT11_MAC_ADDRESS PeerMacAddress;
  ULONG             uSessionId;
  BOOL              bPortControlled;
  BOOL              bPortAuthorized;
} DOT11_PORT_STATE, *PDOT11_PORT_STATE;
```


## -struct-fields




### -field PeerMacAddress

The media access control (MAC) address of the AP or peer station with which the security session
     has been initiated.


### -field uSessionId

The security session identifier (ID) assigned by the operating system.


### -field bPortControlled

A Boolean value that defines whether the port is controlled for access to the BSS network. A value
     of <b>TRUE</b> specifies that the port has controlled access to the network.


For more information about controlled and uncontrolled port access, refer to Clause 6.3 of the IEEE
     802.1X-1999 standard.


### -field bPortAuthorized

A Boolean value that defines whether the port is authorized to access the BSS network. A value of
     <b>TRUE</b> specifies that the port has been authorized for network access.


For more information about authorized port access, refer to Clause 6.3 of the IEEE 802.1X-1999
     standard.


## -remarks



The operating system passes in the current port state of the security session through the
    <i>pPortState</i> parameter of the
    <a href="..\wlanihv\nc-wlanihv-dot11extihv_perform_post_associate.md">
    Dot11ExtIhvPerformPostAssociate</a> IHV handler function. When this function is called, the IHV
    Extensions DLL must not change the data referenced by the
    <i>pPortState</i> parameter.
