# IStiUSD::RawWriteCommand


## -description


A still image minidriver's <b>IStiDevice::RawWriteCommand</b> method sends command information to a still image device.


## -parameters




### -param lpBuffer

Caller-supplied pointer to a buffer containing data to be sent to the device.


### -param nNumberOfBytes

Caller-supplied number of bytes to be written. This is the number of bytes in the buffer pointed to by <i>lpBuffer</i>.


### -param lpOverlapped

Optional, caller-supplied pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).


## -returns



If the operation succeeds, the method should return S_OK. Otherwise, it should return one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.




## -remarks



It is only necessary to call <b>IStiUSD::RawWriteCommand</b> if commands and data are written to a device by different methods. For other devices, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/stiusd/nf-stiusd-istiusd-rawwritedata">IStiUSD::RawWriteData</a> can be used for both commands and data. If the call is not implemented, it must return STIERR_UNSUPPORTED.

Implementation of this method, along with the meaning of buffer contents, are vendor-defined.
