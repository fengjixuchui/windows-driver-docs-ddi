# ExtRemoteData::Write


## -description


The <b>Write</b> method writes the data cached by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/engextcpp/nf-engextcpp-extremotedata-extremotedata(pcstr_ulong64_ulong)">ExtRemoteData</a> object to the region of memory on the target, represented by this object.


## -returns



This method does not return a value.




## -remarks



This method can be used to reset the region of memory on the target to the currently cached value that was previously read from the target.

It is also possible to directly set the value cached by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/engextcpp/nf-engextcpp-extremotedata-extremotedata(pcstr_ulong64_ulong)">ExtRemoteData</a> object, for example:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>ExtRemoteData ext_remote_data = new ExtRemoteData(address, sizeof(USHORT));
ext_remote_data.m_Data = (ULONG64) my_ushort;
ext_remote_data.Write();</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
