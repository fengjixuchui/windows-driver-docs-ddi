# ExtRemoteData::ReadBuffer


## -description


The <b>ReadBuffer</b> method reads data from the target's memory.  The data is located in the beginning of the region represented by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/engextcpp/nf-engextcpp-extremotedata-extremotedata(pcstr_ulong64_ulong)">ExtRemoteData</a> object.  However, the size of the data can be different.


## -parameters




### -param Buffer [out]

Pointer that receives the data read from the target.


### -param Bytes [in]

Specifies the number of bytes to read.  The <i>Buffer</i> buffer must be at least this size.


### -param MustReadAll [in]

Specifies what happens if the debugger engine is unable to read all the data from the target.  If <i>MustReadAll</i> is <code>true</code> and the debugger engine is unable to read <i>Bytes</i> bytes from the target, an <b>ExtRemoteException</b> will be thrown.  If <i>MustReadAll</i>  is <code>false</code>, no exception will be thrown if the engine is unable to read the requested number of bytes from the target.


## -returns



<b>ReadBuffer</b> returns the number of bytes read from the target and copied into the <i>Buffer</i> buffer.  If <i>MustReadAll</i> is <code>true</code>, the value of <i>Bytes</i> will be returned (unless an exception is thrown).
