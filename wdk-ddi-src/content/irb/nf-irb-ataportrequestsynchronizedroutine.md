# AtaPortRequestSynchronizedRoutine function


## -description


The <b>AtaPortRequestSynchronizedRoutine</b> routine is used by the miniport driver to request synchronization with the interrupt service routine (ISR).
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param ChannelExtension [in]

A pointer to the channel extension.


### -param CallBackRoutine

<p>A pointer to the routine to call. </p>




## -returns



None 




## -remarks



This routine is typically used by miniport drivers that set the <b>SyncWithIsr</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/ns-irb-_ide_channel_configuration">IDE_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION</a> structure to <b>FALSE</b>. When <b>SyncWithIsr</b> is set to <b>FALSE</b>, the miniport driver should use the <b>AtaPortRequestSynchronizedRoutine </b>routine to ensure synchronized access to data structures that are modified in the ISR. 

The pointer to the channel extension that is stored in <i>ChannelExtension</i> will be passed to the worker routine when it is called.

When the port driver calls the routine that is pointed to by <i>SynchronizedRoutine</i>, it passes the pointer to the channel extension that is stored in <i>ChannelExtension</i>.

The <i>SynchronizedRoutine</i> function pointer is declared in <i>Irb.h</i> as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef
VOID
(*IDE_HW_DPC) (
  IN PVOID ChannelExtension
  );</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
