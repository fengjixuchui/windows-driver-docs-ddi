# AtaPortMoveMemory function


## -description


The <b>AtaPortMoveMemory</b> routine copies data from one location to another.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param WriteBuffer [out]

A pointer to the destination buffer.


### -param ReadBuffer [in]

A pointer to the source buffer.


### -param Length [in]

Specifies the number of bytes to transfer from <i>ReadBuffer</i> to <i>WriteBuffer</i>.


## -returns



None 




## -remarks



The miniport driver calls the <b>AtaPortMoveMemory</b> routine to copy data from one system-allocated area to another. 

The location pointed to by <i>ReadBuffer</i> and <i>Length</i> can overlap the range of addresses between <i>WriteBuffer</i> and <i>Length</i>.
