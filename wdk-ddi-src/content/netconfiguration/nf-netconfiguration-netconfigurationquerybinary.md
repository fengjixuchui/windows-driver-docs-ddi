Retrieves the data that is currently assigned to a specified registry value, stores the data in a framework-allocated buffer, and creates a framework memory object to represent the buffer.

## -parameters

### -param Configuration

A handle to a NETCONFIGURATION object that represents an opened registry key.

### -param ValueName

A pointer to a [**UNICODE_STRING**](../wudfwdm/ns-wudfwdm-_unicode_string.md) structure that contains a value name. 

### -param PoolType

A [**POOL_TYPE**](../wdm/ne-wdm-_pool_type.md)-typed value that specifies the type of memory to be allocated for the data buffer. 

### -param MemoryAttributes

A pointer to a [**WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES**](../wdfobject/ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes.md) structure that contains object attributes for the new memory object. This parameter is optional and can be **WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES**. 

### -param Memory

A pointer to a location that receives a handle to the new memory object. The framework allocates this memory buffer and automatically frees it when the NETCONFIGURATION object is closed.

## -returns

The method returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method may return an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.

## -remarks

The client driver obtains a handle to a NETCONFIGURATION object by calling [NetAdapterOpenConfiguration](../netadapter/nf-netadapter-netadapteropenconfiguration.md) or [NetConfigurationOpenSubConfiguration](nf-netconfiguration-netconfigurationopensubconfiguration.md).

The memory allocated by this method is automatically freed by the framework when the NETCONFIGURATION object is closed.
