# EVT_SERCX2_FILEOPEN callback function


## -description

The <i>EvtSerCx2FileOpen</i> event callback function is called by version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) to notify the serial controller driver that a client opened a logical connection to the serial controller device and that a file object has been created to represent this connection.

## -parameters

### -param Device 

[in]
A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller. The serial controller driver created this object in its <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a> callback function. For more information, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2initializedevice">SerCx2InitializeDevice</a>.

## -returns

The <i>EvtSerCx2FileOpen</i> function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error status code.

## -remarks

Your serial controller driver can, as an option, implement this function. If implemented, the driver registers this function in the call to the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2initializedevice">SerCx2InitializeDevice</a> method that finishes the initialization of the framework device object for the serial controller. SerCx2 calls the <i>EvtSerCx2FileOpen</i> function when a client driver opens a file handle to the serial controller driver stack.

For more information, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/framework-file-objects">Framework File Objects</a>.


#### Examples

To define an <i>EvtSerCx2FileOpen</i> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/code-analysis-for-drivers">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define an <i>EvtSerCx2FileOpen</i> callback function that is named <code>MyFileOpen</code>, use the <b>EVT_SERCX2_FILEOPEN</b> function type, as shown in this code example:


```cpp
EVT_SERCX2_FILEOPEN  MyFileOpen;
```

Then, implement your callback function as follows:


```cpp
_Use_decl_annotations_
NTSTATUS
  MyFileOpen(
    WDFDEVICE  Device
    )
  {...}
```

The <b>EVT_SERCX2_FILEOPEN</b> function type is defined in the Sercx.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>EVT_SERCX2_FILEOPEN</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/declaring-functions-by-using-function-role-types-for-kmdf-drivers">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for KMDF Drivers</a>. For more information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-behavior">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
