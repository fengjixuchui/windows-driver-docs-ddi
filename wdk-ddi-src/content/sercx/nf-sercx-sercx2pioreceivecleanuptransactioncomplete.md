# SerCx2PioReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete function


## -description


The <b>SerCx2PioReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete</b> method informs version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) that the serial controller driver has finished cleaning up the serial controller's hardware state after a PIO-receive transaction.


## -parameters




### -param PioReceive [in]

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2PIORECEIVE</a> handle to a PIO-receive object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2pioreceivecreate">SerCx2PioReceiveCreate</a> method to create this object.


## -remarks



After a PIO-receive transaction ends, SerCx2 calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_pio_receive_cleanup_transaction">EvtSerCx2PioReceiveCleanupTransaction</a> event callback function, if it is implemented, to clean up the serial controller state. In response to this call, the driver should first do any clean-up work that is needed; then the driver must call <b>SerCx2PioReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete</b> to notify SerCx2. SerCx2 expects this notification and does not start the next transaction until it is notified.

The serial controller driver must call <b>SerCx2PioReceiveCleanupTransactionComplete</b> only in response to a call to the <i>EvtSerCx2PioReceiveCleanupTransaction</i> function.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dn265332(v=vs.85)">SerCx2 PIO-Receive Transactions</a>.
