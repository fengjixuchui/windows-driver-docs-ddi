# EVT_SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE callback function


## -description

The <i>EvtSerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionInitialize</i> event callback function is called by version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) to prepare the serial controller hardware to perform a new custom-receive transaction.

## -parameters

### -param CustomReceiveTransaction 

[in]
A <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION</a> handle to a custom-receive-transaction object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customreceivetransactioncreate">SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCreate</a> method to create this object.

### -param Mdl 

[in]
A pointer to an <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl">MDL</a> that describes the memory pages that are spanned by the read buffer for the custom-receive transaction. The scatter/gather list for the DMA transfer will use the region of this memory that is specified by the <i>Offset</i> and <i>Length</i> parameters.

### -param Offset 

[in]
The starting offset for the data transfer. This parameter is a byte offset from the start of the buffer region described by the MDL. If the MDL specifies a total of N bytes of buffer space, possible values of <i>Offset</i> are in the range 0 to N–1.

### -param Length 

[in]
The size, in bytes, of the data transfer. If the MDL specifies a total of N bytes of buffer space, possible values of <i>Length</i> are in the range 1 to N–<i>Offset</i>.

## -remarks

Your serial controller driver can, as an option, implement this function. If implemented, the driver registers the function in the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customreceivetransactioncreate">SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCreate</a> call that creates the custom-receive object.

Your driver should implement an <i>EvtSerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionInitialize</i> function if it needs to initialize the serial controller and associated hardware in preparation for a new custom-receive transaction. SerCx2 calls this function, if it is implemented, before starting the custom-receive transaction. In response to this call, the serial controller driver must call the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customreceivetransactioninitializecomplete">SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionInitializeComplete</a> method to notify SerCx2 after the initialization is finished.

For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/dn265314(v=vs.85)">SerCx2 Custom-Receive Transactions</a>.


#### Examples

To define an <i>EvtSerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionInitialize</i> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/code-analysis-for-drivers">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define an <i>EvtSerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionInitialize</i> callback function that is named <code>MyCustomReceiveTransactionInitialize</code>, use the <b>EVT_SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE</b> function type, as shown in this code example:


```cpp
EVT_SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE  MyCustomReceiveTransactionInitialize;
```

Then, implement your callback function as follows:


```cpp
_Use_decl_annotations_
VOID
  MyCustomReceiveTransactionInitialize(
    SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION  CustomReceiveTransaction,
    WDFREQUEST  Request,
    PMDL  Mdl,
    ULONG  Offset,
    ULONG  Length
    )
  {...}
```

The <b>EVT_SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE</b> function type is defined in the Sercx.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>EVT_SERCX2_CUSTOM_RECEIVE_TRANSACTION_INITIALIZE</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/declaring-functions-by-using-function-role-types-for-kmdf-drivers">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for KMDF Drivers</a>.
