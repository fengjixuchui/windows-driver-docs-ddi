# SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCleanupComplete function


## -description


The <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCleanupComplete</b> method informs version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) that the serial controller driver has finished cleaning up the serial controller's hardware state after a custom-receive transaction.


## -parameters




### -param CustomReceiveTransaction [in]

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2CUSTOMRECEIVETRANSACTION</a> handle to a custom-receive object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx2customreceivetransactioncreate">SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCreate</a> method to create this object.


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



After a custom-receive transaction ends, SerCx2 calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sercx/nc-sercx-evt_sercx2_custom_receive_transaction_cleanup">EvtSerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCleanup</a> event callback function, if it is implemented, to clean up the serial controller state. In response to this call, the driver should first do any clean-up work that is needed; then the driver must call <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCleanupComplete</b> to notify SerCx2. SerCx2 expects this notification and does not start the next transaction until it is notified.

The serial controller driver must call <b>SerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCleanupComplete</b> only in response to a call to the <i>EvtSerCx2CustomReceiveTransactionCleanup</i> function.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dn265314(v=vs.85)">SerCx2 Custom-Receive Transactions</a>.
