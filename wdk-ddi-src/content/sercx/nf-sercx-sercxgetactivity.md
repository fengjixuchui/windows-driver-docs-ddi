# SerCxGetActivity function


## -description


The <b>SerCxGetActivity</b> method retrieves the status of pending work for the serial controller driver.


## -parameters




### -param Device [in]

A WDFDEVICE handle to the framework device object that represents the serial controller.


### -param Activity [in, out]

A pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sercx/ns-sercx-_sercx_activity">SERCX_ACTIVITY</a> structure. The caller must have previously called the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx_activity_init">SERCX_ACTIVITY_INIT</a> function to initialize this structure before its initial use. Thereafter, each <b>SerCxGetActivity</b> call updates the contents of this structure to track the work items that are ready to be processed by the controller driver.


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



The serial controller driver calls this method to receive a summary of processing work that it needs to perform on behalf of the serial framework extension (SerCx). Typically, <b>SerCxGetActivity</b> is called by the transmit/receive DPC routine in the controller driver.

The <i>Activity</i> parameter points to a <b>SERCX_ACTIVITY</b> structure that describes pending work for the controller driver. The pending work that SerCx assigns to the controller driver is driven by I/O requests from clients, but an I/O request does not necessarily spawn a work item. For example, if SerCx has a sufficient amount of received data in its memory buffer to complete a pending read request, this request does not cause the <b>Receiving</b> member of the <b>SERCX_ACTIVITY</b> structure to be set to TRUE.

To cycle through pending work items, the transmit/receive DPC routine calls <b>SerCxGetActivity</b>, processes a complete transmit or receive operation, and then calls <b>SerCxGetActivity</b> again to determine whether another operation of a different type requires work. If another operation requires work, this work might begin during the same callback but must stop if the return value from a call to <b>SerCxProgressReceive</b> or <b>SerCxProgressTransmit</b> directs the DPC routine to reschedule itself to run at a later time.

A lock protects the <b>SERCX_ACTIVITY</b> structure that is updated by the <b>SerCxGetActivity</b> call. During the call, this lock is acquired by event handlers in SerCx to update the summary of work that is currently pending for the controller driver.
