# SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes a data buffer for a receive operation or transmit operation.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of this structure.  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercxretrievereceivebuffer">SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercxretrievetransmitbuffer">SerCxRetrieveTransmitBuffer</a> methods use this member to determine which version of the structure the caller is using. The size of this structure might change in future versions of the Sercx.h header file.


### -field Buffer

The virtual memory address of the buffer. The memory for the buffer is nonpaged.


### -field Length

The number of bytes available in the buffer. This size determines the maximize number of bytes that can be transferred by the receive or transmit operation.


## -remarks



The serial  controller driver uses the information in this structure to determine where in memory to read data from during a receive operation, and where in memory to write data during a transmit operation.

At any time, there can be no more than one valid receive buffer and one valid transmit buffer.  The controller driver calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercxretrievereceivebuffer">SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</a> method to obtain the receive buffer, and calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercxretrievetransmitbuffer">SerCxRetrieveTransmitBuffer</a> method to obtain the transmit buffer.  Both methods copy buffer descriptions into caller-allocated <b>SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structures. A subsequent call to one of these methods invalidates the previously issued descriptor for the receive buffer or transmit buffer, respectively.  The caller must not access a buffer that is described by a buffer descriptor that is no longer valid.

The buffers that are obtained by successive calls to <b>SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</b> or <b>SerCxRetrieveTransmitBuffer</b> are not guaranteed to be contiguous.

The controller driver must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercx_buffer_descriptor_init">SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR_INIT</a> function to initialize an <b>SERCX_BUFFER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure before the structure is passed to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercxretrievereceivebuffer">SerCxRetrieveReceiveBuffer</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sercx/nf-sercx-sercxretrievetransmitbuffer">SerCxRetrieveTransmitBuffer</a> method. After a buffer descriptor is initialized, it can be reused without being initialized again.
