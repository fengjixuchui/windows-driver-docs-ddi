# RxRegisterMinirdr function


## -description


<b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> is called by a network mini-redirector driver to register the driver with RDBSS, which adds the registration information to an internal registration table. RDBSS also builds a device object for the network mini-redirector. 


## -parameters




### -param DeviceObject [out]

A pointer to where the created device object will be stored.


### -param DriverObject [in, out]

A pointer to the driver object of the network mini-redirector driver. Each driver receives a pointer to its driver object in a parameter to its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/driverentry-of-ide-controller-minidriver">DriverEntry</a> routine. This driver object will be used to create the device object for the network mini-redirector driver. 


### -param MrdrDispatch [in]

A pointer to the dispatch table for the network mini-redirector. This dispatch table includes configuration information for the network mini-redirector and a table of pointers to callback routines implemented by the network mini-redirector kernel driver. RDBSS makes calls to the network mini-redirector driver through this list of callback routines. 


### -param Controls [in]

The set of options that determine capabilities of the network mini-redirector driver and how RDBSS should handle initialization and name table caching for the network mini-redirector driver. These options can include any combination of the following bits:





#### RX_REGISTERMINI_FLAG_DONT_PROVIDE_UNCS

When this flag is set, it indicates that the network mini-redirector does not support UNC names.



#### RX_REGISTERMINI_FLAG_DONT_PROVIDE_MAILSLOTS

When this flag is set, it indicates that the network mini-redirector does not support mailslots.



#### RX_REGISTERMINI_FLAG_DONT_INIT_DRIVER_DISPATCH

When this flag is set, it indicates that the network mini-redirector does not want RDBSS to initialize the driver dispatch entry points of the mini-redirector driver to point to RDBSS internal routines. This option would only be used in unusual circumstances. Normally RDBSS would set the driver dispatch entry points and the fast I/O dispatch in the network mini-redirector driver object to point to routines internal to RDBSS.



#### RX_REGISTERMINI_FLAG_DONT_INIT_PREFIX_N_SCAVENGER

When this flag is set, it indicates that the network mini-redirector does not want RDBSS to initialize its internal network name table and scavenger data structures for scavenging this name table. This option would be set for a network mini-redirector that wants to handle caching for network share names itself and not use the RDBSS facilities for name caching and scavenging.


### -param DeviceName [in]

A pointer to a buffer that contains a zero-terminated Unicode string that names the device object. The string must be a full path name. This parameter is passed as <i>DeviceName</i> to the <b>IoCreateDevice</b> routine by RDBSS.


### -param DeviceExtensionSize [in]

The size specified by the mini-redirector driver for the number of bytes to be allocated for the device extension of the device object. The internal structure of the device extension is driver-defined. This parameter is added to the size of the device extension used by RDBSS and passed as the <i>DeviceExtensionSize</i> parameter to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-iocreatedevice">IoCreateDevice</a> routine by RDBSS.


### -param DeviceType [in]

The device type used when the device object is created. This specifies one of the system-defined FILE_DEVICE_XXX constants that indicate the type of device or a vendor-defined value for a new type of device. This value would normally be FILE_DEVICE_NETWORK_FILE_SYSTEM for network mini-redirector drivers. This parameter is passed as <i>DeviceType</i> to the <b>IoCreateDevice</b> routine by RDBSS. 


### -param DeviceCharacteristics [in]

The device characteristics used when the device object is created. This specifies one or more system-defined constants, combined together, that provide additional information about the driver's device. This value must include FILE_REMOTE_DEVICE for network mini-redirector drivers, but this might be combined with other characteristics such as FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN. This parameter is passed as <i>DeviceCharacteristics</i> to the <b>IoCreateDevice</b> routine by RDBSS. 


## -returns



<b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success or one of the following error values on failure:

## -remarks



A network mini-redirector registers with RDBSS whenever the driver is loaded by the kernel and unregisters with RDBSS when the driver is unloaded. A non-monolithic driver (the SMB network mini-redirector) communicates with the <i>Rdbss.sys</i>, another kernel driver. For a monolithic network mini-redirector driver that statically links with <i>Rdbsslib.lib</i>, this communication is merely a call to an <i>Rdbsslib.lib</i> library routine.

A network mini-redirector informs RDBSS that it has been loaded by calling <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b>, the registration routine exported from RDBSS. When a network mini-redirector driver first starts (in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/driverentry-of-ide-controller-minidriver">DriverEntry</a> routine), the driver calls the RDBSS <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> routine to register the network mini-redirector driver with RDBSS. Based on the parameters passed to <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b>, RDBSS calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-iocreatedevice">IoCreateDevice</a> to create the device object for the network mini-redirector driver. 

As part of this registration process, the network mini-redirector passes a parameter to <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> that is a pointer to a large structure, MINIRDR_DISPATCH, which contains configuration information for the network mini-redirector and a dispatch table of pointers to callback routines implemented by the network mini-redirector driver. This configuration data is used to configure internal RDBSS tables for use with this network mini-redirector. RDBSS uses the callback routines passed in this structure to communicate with the network mini-redirector. A network mini-redirector can chose to implement only some of these callback routines. Any callback routine that is not implemented should be set to a <b>NULL</b> pointer in the dispatch table passed to RDBSS. Only callback routines implemented by the network mini-redirector will be called by RDBSS. 

Note that the <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> routine sets all of the driver dispatch routines of the network mini-redirector driver to point to the top-level RDBSS dispatch routine, <b>RxFsdDispatch</b>. A network mini-redirector can override this behavior by saving a copy of its driver dispatch entry points, calling <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b>, and rewriting the driver dispatch with its own entry points after the call to <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> returns. A network mini-redirector can also prevent its driver dispatch routines from being copied over by the <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> routine if the RX_REGISTERMINI_FLAG_DONT_INIT_DRIVER_DISPATCH bit is set in the <i>Controls</i> parameter.

If the <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> call is successful, a number of members in RDBSS_DEVICE_OBJECT pointed to by the <i>DeviceObject</i> parameter are initialized including the following: 

<ul>
<li>
The <b>Dispatch</b> member is set to the <i>MrdrDispatch</i> parameter.

</li>
<li>
The <b>RegistrationControls</b> member is set to the <i>Controls</i> parameter.

</li>
<li>
The <b>DeviceName</b> member is set to the <i>DeviceName</i> parameter.

</li>
<li>
The <b>RegisterUncProvider</b> member is set to <b>TRUE</b> if the RX_REGISTERMINI_FLAG_DONT_PROVIDE_UNCS bit in the <i>Controls</i> parameter was not set.

</li>
<li>
The <b>RegisterMailSlotProvider</b> member is set to <b>TRUE</b> if the RX_REGISTERMINI_FLAG_DONT_PROVIDE_MAILSLOTS bit in the <i>Controls</i> parameter was not set.

</li>
<li>
The <b>NetworkProviderPriority</b> member is set to the network provider priority that MUP will use.

</li>
</ul>
If the <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> call is successful and the RX_REGISTERMINI_FLAG_DONT_INIT_PREFIX_N_SCAVENGER bit in the <i>Controls</i> parameter is not set, a number of other members in RDBSS_DEVICE_OBJECT pointed to by the <i>DeviceObject</i> parameter are initialized, including the following: 

<ul>
<li>
The <b>pRxNetNameTable</b> member structure is initialized.

</li>
<li>
The <b>RxNetNameTableInDeviceObject.IsNetNameTable</b> member is set to <b>TRUE</b>.

</li>
<li>
The <b>pRdbssScavenger</b> member structure is initialized.

</li>
</ul>
If the <b>RxRegisterMinirdr</b> call is successful, RDBSS sets the internal state of the network mini-redirector in RDBSS to RDBSS_STARTABLE.

The network mini-redirector does not actually start operation until it receives a call to its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/mrx/nc-mrx-pmrx_calldown_ctx">MRxStart</a> routine, one of the callback routines passed in the MINIRDR_DISPATCH structure. The <b>MrxStart</b> callback routine must be implemented by the network mini-redirector driver if it wishes to receive callbacks for operations, unless the network mini-redirector preserves its own driver dispatch entry points. Otherwise, RDBSS will only allow the following I/O request packets through to the driver until <b>MrxStart</b> returns successfully:

<ul>
<li>
IRP requests for device create operations and device operations where the <i>FileObject->FileName.Length</i> parameter on the IRPSP is zero and the <i>FileObject->RelatedFileObject</i> parameter is <b>NULL</b>.

</li>
</ul>
For any other IRP request, the RDBSS dispatch routine, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/mrx/nf-mrx-rxfsddispatch">RxFsdDispatch</a>, will return a status of STATUS_REDIRECTOR_NOT_STARTED. 

The RDBSS dispatch routine will also fail any requests for the following I/O request packets:

<ul>
<li>
IRP_MJ_CREATE_MAILSLOT

</li>
<li>
IRP_MJ_CREATE_NAMED_PIPE

</li>
</ul>
The network mini-redirector <b>MrxStart</b> routine is called by RDBSS when the <b>RxStartMiniRdr</b> routine is called. The RDBSS <b>RxStartMinirdr</b> is usually called as a result of an FSCTL or IOCTL request from a user-mode application or service to start the network mini-redirector. The call to <b>RxStartMinirdr </b>cannot be made from the <b>DriverEntry</b> routine of the network mini-redirector after a successful call to <b>RxRegisterMinirdr </b>because some of the start processing requires that the driver initialization be completed. Once the <b>RxStartMinirdr</b> call is received, RDBSS completes the start process by calling the <b>MrxStart</b> routine of the network mini-redirector. If the call to <b>MrxStart</b> returns success, RDBSS sets the internal state of the mini-redirector in RDBSS to RDBSS_STARTED.
