# NetPacketGetExtension function


## -description


The **NetPacketGetExtension** method retrieves information stored in one of a packet's extensions.

## -parameters

### -param packet

A pointer to a [**NET_PACKET**](ns-packet-_net_packet.md) structure. 

### -param offset

The offset, in bytes, to the desired [**NET_PACKET_EXTENSION**](../netadapterpacket/ns-netadapterpacket-_net_packet_extension.md) from the beginning of the packet's descriptor.

## -returns

Returns a pointer to a structure at the given extension offset that represents packet extension information.

## -remarks

NIC client drivers typically query offsets for packet extensions during datapath queue creation, then store them in their queue context space so they don't have to query them too often. For an example of this, see [Transmit and receive queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/transmit-and-receive-queues). These offsets are then passed to **NetPacketGetExtension** to retrieve data for each packet extension.
