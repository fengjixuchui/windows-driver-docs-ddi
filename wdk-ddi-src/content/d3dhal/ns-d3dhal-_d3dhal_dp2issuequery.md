# _D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY structure


## -description



   DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.
   

One or more D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY structures are parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback when the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure's <b>bCommand</b> member is set to D3DDP2OP_ISSUEQUERY, and are used to query for various types of information.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwQueryID

Identifies the query for which the driver asynchronously provides information.


### -field dwFlags

Specifies the state of the query. This member can contain one or more of the following flags: 

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|D3DISSUE_BEGIN (1 << 1)|Starts building the query. The runtime does not request query data while in this state.|
|D3DISSUE_END (1 << 0)|Transitions the state to subsignaled. Results of the query are not available until the state transitions to signaled.|
 

The driver can ignore query requests with **dwFlags** set to 0. 


## -remarks



The runtime uses D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY to identify each query that the driver must process. The driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback must process <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> D3DHAL_DP2ISSUEQUERY structures from the command buffer. The value of <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> is specified in the D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure. The driver parses these structures and retrieves information associated with the queries that they represent.
