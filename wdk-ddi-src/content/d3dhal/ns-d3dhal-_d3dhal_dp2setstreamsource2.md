# _D3DHAL_DP2SETSTREAMSOURCE2 structure


## -description

   DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.
   

The D3DHAL_DP2SETSTREAMSOURCE2 structure is used to bind a portion of a vertex stream source to a vertex buffer for <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.

## -struct-fields

### -field dwStream

Specifies the stream being bound. It has a value between zero and the maximum number of streams specified by the driver.

### -field dwVBHandle

Specifies the vertex buffer handle. It is legal for the vertex buffer handle to be zero, in which case the stream is no longer bound to a vertex buffer.

### -field dwOffset

Specifies the offset of the first vertex size in bytes.

### -field dwStride

Specifies the vertex size in bytes.
