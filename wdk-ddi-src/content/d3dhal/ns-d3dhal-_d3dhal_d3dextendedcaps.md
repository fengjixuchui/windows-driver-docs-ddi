# _D3DHAL_D3DEXTENDEDCAPS structure


## -description


D3DHAL_D3DEXTENDEDCAPS describes additional 3D capabilities of the driver.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwSize

Specifies the size in bytes of this D3DHAL_D3DEXTENDEDCAPS structure.


### -field dwMinTextureWidth

 
Specify the minimum texture width, in pixels, supported by the driver or device. This member is typically a power of 2. These members are provided as hints to the application, and it is the application's responsibility to adjust texture sizes when necessary.

### -field dwMaxTextureWidth

 
Specify the maximum texture width, in pixels, supported by the driver or device. This member is typically a power of 2. These members are provided as hints to the application, and it is the application's responsibility to adjust texture sizes when necessary.

### -field dwMinTextureHeight

 
Specify the minimum texture height, in pixels, supported by the driver. This member is typically a power of 2.

### -field dwMaxTextureHeight

Specify the maximum texture height, in pixels, supported by the driver. This member is typically a power of 2.


### -field dwMinStippleWidth

Specify the minimum stipple width, in pixels, supported by the driver.


### -field dwMaxStippleWidth

Specify the maximum stipple width, in pixels, supported by the driver.


### -field dwMinStippleHeight

Specify the minimum stipple height, in pixels, supported by the driver.


### -field dwMaxStippleHeight

Specify the maximum stipple height, in pixels, supported by the driver.


### -field dwMaxTextureRepeat

Specifies the full range of integer (subfractional) bits of the postnormalized texture indexes. If the D3DDEVCAPS_TEXREPEATNOTSCALEDBYSIZE bit is set, then the number of times a texture can be wrapped is specified by this member. If the D3DDEVCAPS_TEXREPEATNOTSCALEDBYSIZE bit is not set, then the number of time a texture can be wrapped is given by the expression: <b>dwMaxTextureRepeat</b> * (<i>texture size</i>).


### -field dwMaxTextureAspectRatio

Specifies the maximum texture aspect ratio supported by the hardware. This member is typically a power of 2. This maximum aspect ratio is provided as a measure of the texture's height in pixels divided by its width in pixels, or its width divided by height, whichever produces the greater result. For example, a texture that is 8192 pixels wide by 1 pixel high or 1 pixel wide by 8192 high is invalid with a display device that only supports a maximum aspect ratio of 4092. If the hardware is not limited in aspect ratio, <b>dwMaxTextureAspectRatio</b> is the larger of <b>dwMaxTextureWidth</b> and <b>dwMaxTextureHeight</b>.


### -field dwMaxAnisotropy

Specifies the maximum valid value for the D3DRENDERSTATE_ANISOTROPY render state. If the driver's hardware does not support anisotropic filtering, the driver should set this member to 1. Setting this member to 0 represents an invalid value.


### -field dvGuardBandLeft


### -field dvGuardBandTop


### -field dvGuardBandRight


### -field dvGuardBandBottom

Specify the screen-space coordinates, in pixels, of the guard-band clip region. The upper-left corner of this rectangle has coordinates (<b>dvGuardBandLeft</b>, <b>dvGuardBandTop</b>). The lower-left corner has coordinates (<b>dvGuardBandRight</b>, <b>dvGuardBandBottom</b>). Coordinates inside this rectangle but outside the viewport rectangle are automatically clipped. 


### -field dvExtentsAdjust

Specifies the number of pixels required to adjust the extents rectangle outward to accommodate antialiasing kernels.


### -field dwStencilCaps

Specifies the stencil buffer operations supported by the driver or device. For further descriptions of the stencil buffer operations shown in the following table, see D3DSTENCILOP in the DirectX SDK documentation. Stencil operations are assumed to be valid for all three stencil buffer operation render states (D3DRENDERSTATE_STENCILFAIL, D3DRENDERSTATE_STENCILPASS, and D3DRENDERSTATE_STENCILZFAIL). This member can be a bitwise OR of any of the following values:

|Value|Stencil Buffer Operation|
|--- |--- |
|D3DSTENCILCAPS_DECR|The D3DSTENCILOP_DECR operation is supported.|
|D3DSTENCILCAPS_DECRSAT|The D3DSTENCILOP_DECRSAT operation is supported.|
|D3DSTENCILCAPS_INCR|The D3DSTENCILOP_INCR operation is supported.|
|D3DSTENCILCAPS_INCRSAT|The D3DSTENCILOP_INCRSAT operation is supported.|
|D3DSTENCILCAPS_INVERT|The D3DSTENCILOP_INVERT operation is supported.|
|D3DSTENCILCAPS_KEEP|The D3DSTENCILOP_KEEP operation is supported.|
|D3DSTENCILCAPS_REPLACE|The D3DSTENCILOP_REPLACE operation is supported.|
|D3DSTENCILCAPS_ZERO|The D3DSTENCILOP_ZERO operation is supported.|
 


### -field dwFVFCaps

Specifies the number of texture coordinates that the driver can process. This value can be an integer in the range 0 through 8, where 0 indicates that the driver does not support texturing, 1 indicates that the driver can process only one set of texture coordinates, 2 indicates that the driver can process two sets of texture coordinates, and so on.

A driver must be able to parse all texture coordinates present in the vertex data regardless of the number of texture coordinates that the driver actually uses. The driver should use the index provided with the D3DTSS_TEXCOORDINDEX value of the D3DTEXTURESTAGESTATETYPE enumeration, described in the DirectX SDK documentation, to determine what texture coordinate set to use when rendering.


### -field dwTextureOpCaps

Specifies the texture operations supported by the device. See D3DTEXTUREOP in the DirectX SDK documentation for descriptions of the texture operations listed in the following table. This member can be a bitwise OR of the following values:

## -remarks



The driver allocates and zero-initializes this structure and sets appropriate values in the members it supports. The driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_getdriverinfo">DdGetDriverInfo</a> function returns a pointer to this structure when that function is called with the GUID_D3DExtendedCaps GUID.

When the driver fills in this structure, it can set values for execute buffer capabilities even when the interface being used to retrieve the capabilities (such as <b>lDirect3DDevice3</b>) does not support execute buffers.
