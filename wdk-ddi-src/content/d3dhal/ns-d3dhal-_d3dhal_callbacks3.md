# _D3DHAL_CALLBACKS3 structure


## -description

D3DHAL_CALLBACKS3 is one of several callback structures that describe the Direct3D support provided by the driver.

## -struct-fields

### -field dwSize

Specifies the size in bytes of this structure.

### -field dwFlags

Indicates the callbacks associated with this structure that the driver has implemented. For every bit the driver sets in <b>dwFlags</b>, the driver must initialize the corresponding function pointer member of this structure. This member can be the bitwise-OR of one or more of the following flags:

| **Flag** | **Meaning** | 
|:--|:--|
| D3DHAL3_CB32_CLEAR2 | Not used in DirectX 7.0 and later versions. | 
| D3DHAL3_CB32_DRAWPRIMITIVES2 | The DrawPrimitives2member points to a driver-implemented [D3dDrawPrimitives2](./nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb.md)  callback. | 
| D3DHAL3_CB32_RESERVED | Not used in DirectX 7.0 and later versions. | 
| D3DHAL3_CB32_VALIDATETEXTURESTAGESTATE | The ValidateTextureStageStatemember points to a driver-implemented [D3dValidateTextureStageState](./nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_validatetexturestagestatecb.md) callback. |

### -field Clear2

Must be set to <b>NULL</b>. This was a pointer to the driver-supplied <b>D3dClear2</b> callback that is no longer used for DirectX 7.0 and beyond. Instead the driver should respond to the D3DDP2OP_CLEAR command stream token in its implementation of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.

### -field lpvReserved

Specifies a reserved field and must be set to <b>NULL</b> in a Windows 2000 and later driver.

### -field ValidateTextureStageState

Points to the driver-supplied <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_validatetexturestagestatecb">D3dValidateTextureStageState</a> callback, or <b>NULL</b>. Drivers that support multitexturing must implement the callback that this member points to.

### -field DrawPrimitives2

Points to the driver-supplied <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback. A driver must implement the callback that this member points to.

## -remarks

The driver allocates this structure and sets appropriate values in all members. The driver's <a href="/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/nc-ddrawint-pdd_getdriverinfo">DdGetDriverInfo</a> function returns a pointer to this structure when that function is called with the GUID_D3DCallbacks3 GUID.
