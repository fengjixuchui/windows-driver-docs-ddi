# _D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE structure


## -description

   DirectX 9.0 and later versions only.
   

One or more D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE structures are parsed from the response buffer that the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback returns to the runtime. Each structure specifies the availability of responses to previously issued queries.

## -struct-fields

### -field bCommand

Specifies a response token. This member can be either D3DDP2OP_RESPONSECONTINUE or D3DDP2OP_RESPONSEQUERY of the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ne-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2operation">D3DHAL_DP2OPERATION</a> enumerated type.

### -field bReserved

Reserved for system use and should be ignored by the driver.

### -field wStateCount

Specifies the number of responses (that is, the number of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2responsequery">D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSEQUERY</a> structures) that follow this D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE structure. If the driver sets <b>bCommand</b> to D3DDP2OP_RESPONSECONTINUE, the driver should set this member to zero. However, the runtime ignores this member when <b>bCommand</b> is set to D3DDP2OP_RESPONSECONTINUE; this member is only valid when the driver sets <b>bCommand</b> to D3DDP2OP_RESPONSEQUERY.

### -field dwTotalSize

Specifies the total size, in bytes, of the responses associated with this D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE structure. The driver also includes the size of this D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE structure in the total size to let the runtime skip over this D3DHAL_DP2RESPONSE structure when parsing the response buffer.
