# _D3DHAL_CALLBACKS structure


## -description

D3DHAL_CALLBACKS is one of several callback structures that describe the Direct3D support provided by the driver.

## -struct-fields

### -field dwSize

Specifies the size in bytes of this D3DHAL_CALLBACKS structure.

### -field ContextCreate

Points to the driver-supplied <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_contextcreatecb">D3dContextCreate</a> callback. A driver must implement the callback that this member points to.

### -field ContextDestroy

Points to the driver-supplied <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_contextdestroycb">D3dContextDestroy</a> callback. A driver must implement the callback that this member points to.

### -field ContextDestroyAll

Must be set to <b>NULL</b> in a Windows 2000 and later driver.

### -field SceneCapture

Must be set to <b>NULL</b> in a Windows 2000 and later driver. For DirectX 6.0, this was a pointer to the driver-supplied <b>D3dSceneCapture</b> callback. For DirectX 7.0 and later, this callback was replaced by the handling of the D3DRENDERSTATE_SCENECAPTURE render state in the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> function.

### -field lpReserved10

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved11

Must be zero.

### -field RenderState

Points to the driver-supplied D3DHAL_RENDERSTATEDATA callback. A driver must implement the callback that this member points to.

### -field RenderPrimitive

Points to the driver-supplied D3DHAL_RENDERPRIMITIVEDATA callback. A driver must implement the callback that this member points to.

### -field dwReserved

Specifies reserved fields and must be set to zero.

### -field TextureCreate

Must be set to <b>NULL</b> in a Windows 2000 and later driver. For DirectX 6.0, this was a pointer to the driver-supplied <b>D3dTextureCreate</b> callback, or <b>NULL</b>.

### -field TextureDestroy

Must be set to <b>NULL</b> in a Windows 2000 and later driver. For DirectX 6.0, this was a pointer to the driver-supplied <b>D3dTextureDestroy</b> callback, or <b>NULL</b>.

### -field TextureSwap

Must be set to <b>NULL</b> in a Windows 2000 and later driver. For DirectX 6.0, this was a pointer to the driver-supplied <b>D3dTextureSwap</b> callback, or <b>NULL</b>.

### -field TextureGetSurf

Must be set to <b>NULL</b> in a Windows 2000 and later driver. For DirectX 6.0, this was a pointer to the driver-supplied <b>D3dTextureGetSurf</b> callback, or <b>NULL</b>.

### -field lpReserved12

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved13

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved14

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved15

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved16

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved17

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved18

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved19

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved20

Must be zero.

### -field lpReserved21

Must be zero.

### -field GetState

Points to the driver-supplied D3DHAL_GETSTATEDATA callback. A driver must implement the callback that this member points to.

### -field dwReserved0

Must be zero.

### -field dwReserved1

Must be zero.

### -field dwReserved2

Must be zero.

### -field dwReserved3

Must be zero.

### -field dwReserved4

Must be zero.

### -field dwReserved5

Must be zero.

### -field dwReserved6

Must be zero.

### -field dwReserved7

Must be zero.

### -field dwReserved8

Must be zero

### -field dwReserved9

Must be zero.

## -remarks

The driver allocates this structure and sets appropriate values in all members. The driver's <a href="/windows/win32/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvgetdirectdrawinfo">DrvGetDirectDrawInfo</a> function returns a pointer to this structure in the <b>lpD3DHALCallbacks</b> member of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/ddrawint/ns-ddrawint-dd_halinfo">DD_HALINFO</a> structure.

Texture management is now handled though opcodes that are managed in the driver's implementation of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a>.
