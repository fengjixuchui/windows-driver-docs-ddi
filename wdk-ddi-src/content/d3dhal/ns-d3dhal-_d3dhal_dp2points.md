# _D3DHAL_DP2POINTS structure


## -description

One or more D3DHAL_DP2POINTS structures are parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback when the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/ns-d3dhal-_d3dhal_dp2command">D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND</a> structure's <b>bCommand</b> member is set to D3DDP2OP_POINTS, and are used to render the specified points.

## -struct-fields

### -field wCount

Specifies the number of points to render.

### -field wVStart

Specifies the index into the vertex buffer containing coordinate data for the initial point.

## -remarks

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> should process <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> D3DHAL_DP2POINTS structures from the command buffer. The value of <b>wPrimitiveCount</b> is specified in the D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure.

For each D3DHAL_DP2POINTS structure, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> should sequentially process <b>wCount</b> vertices from the vertex buffer. Starting from the vertex buffer offset, the sequence of points rendered is <b>wVStart</b>, (<b>wVStart</b>+1), ..., (<b>wVStart</b>+(<b>wCount</b>-1)).

The following figure shows a portion of a sample command buffer containing a D3DDP2OP_POINTS command and two D3DHAL_DP2POINTS structures. The driver should draw a total of seven points using the following vertices from the vertex buffer: v[2], v[3], v[4], v[7], v[8], v[9], v[10].
