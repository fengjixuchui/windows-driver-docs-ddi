## -struct-fields




### -field Header

Specifies the type, revision and size of the <b>DOT11_WFD_ADDITIONAL_IE</b> structure. The required settings for the members of <b>Header</b> are the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Member</th>
<th>Setting</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Type</b></td>
<td>NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Revision</b></td>
<td>DOT11_WFD_ADDITIONAL_IE_REVISION_1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Size</b></td>
<td>DOT11_SIZEOF_WFD_ADDITIONAL_IE_REVISION_1</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field uBeaconIEsOffset

The offset, in bytes, of an array of beacon IEs. This offset is relative to the start of the buffer that contains this structure. The Wi-Fi Direct (WFD) port must add these addition IEs to the beacon packets when it is acting as a Group Owner.


### -field uBeaconIEsLength

The length, in bytes, of the additional IEs at  <b>uBeaconIEsOffset</b>. This member is ignored when the WFD port is operating in device or client mode.


### -field uProbeResponseIEsOffset

The offset, in bytes, of an array of probe response IEs. This offset is relative to the start of the buffer that contains this structure. The Wi-Fi Direct (WFD) port must add these addition IEs to the probe response packets when it is acting as a WFD device or Group Owner.


### -field uProbeResponseIEsLength

The length, in bytes, of the additional IEs at  <b>uProbeResponseIEsOffset</b>. This member is ignored when the WFD port is operating in client mode.


### -field uDefaultRequestIEsOffset

The offset, in bytes, of an array of probe request IEs. This offset is relative to the start of the buffer that contains this structure. The Wi-Fi Direct (WFD) port must add these addition IEs to the probe request packets it transmits.


### -field uDefaultRequestIEsLength

The length, in bytes, of the additional IEs at  <b>uDefaultRequestIEsOffset</b>.


## -remarks



The additional IEs at  <b>uDefaultRequestIEsOffset</b> are for probe requests originating from the driver only. Explicit device discovery requests from the system are initiated in an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-dot11-wfd-discover-request">OID_DOT11_WFD_DISCOVER_REQUEST</a>. The IEs for an explicit discovery request should come from those IEs in the OID_DOT11_WFD_DISCOVER_REQUEST request and not from the IEs at <b>uDefaultRequestIEsOffset</b>.
