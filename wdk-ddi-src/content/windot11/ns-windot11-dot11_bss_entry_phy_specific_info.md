# DOT11_BSS_ENTRY_PHY_SPECIFIC_INFO structure


## -description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/wireless/ff560689(v=vs.85)) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/wifi-universal-driver-model).

The DOT11_BSS_ENTRY_PHY_SPECIFIC_INFO union specifies the attributes of the PHY which received an IEEE 802.11 Beacon or Response Frame during the Native 802.11 miniport driver's last scan operation.

## -syntax

```cpp
typedef union DOT11_BSS_ENTRY_PHY_SPECIFIC_INFO {
  ULONG  uChCenterFrequency;
  struct {
    ULONG uHopPattern;
    ULONG uHopSet;
    ULONG uDwellTime;
  } FHSS;
} DOT11_BSS_ENTRY_PHY_SPECIFIC_INFO, *PDOT11_BSS_ENTRY_PHY_SPECIFIC_INFO;
```

## -struct-fields

### -field uChCenterFrequency

The channel center frequency of the band on which the 802.11 Probe-Response or Beacon frame was received. The value of **uChCenterFrequency** is in units of megahertz (MHz).

> [!NOTE]
> This member is only valid for PHY types that are not frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).

### -field FHSS

The FHSS parameters, as specified by the following members:

#### uHopPattern

The current hopping pattern used by the layer management entity (LME) of the PHY to determine the hopping sequence. For more information about how the hopping sequence is determined, refer to Clause 14.9.2.20 of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.

> [!NOTE]
> This member is only valid for FHSS PHY types.

#### uHopSet

The current set of patterns used by the LME of the PHY to determine the hopping sequence. For more information about the hopping pattern sets, refer to Clause 14.9.2.19 of the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard.

> [!NOTE]
> This member is only valid for FHSS PHY types.

#### uDwellTime

The maximum amount of time that the PHY can use when transmitting on a single channel. The value of **uDwellTime** is in units of 802.11 time units (TU). One TU is 1024 microseconds.

> [!NOTE]
> This member is only valid for FHSS PHY types.

## -remarks

The DOT11_BSS_ENTRY_PHY_SPECIFIC_INFO union is a member of the [DOT11_BSS_ENTRY](../windot11/ns-windot11-dot11_bss_entry.md) structure.
