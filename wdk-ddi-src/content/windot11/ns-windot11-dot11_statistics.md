# DOT11_STATISTICS structure


## -description

<div class="alert"><b>Important</b>  The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/wireless/ff560689(v=vs.85)">Native 802.11 Wireless LAN</a> interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/wifi-universal-driver-model">WLAN Universal Windows driver model</a>.</div>

The DOT11_STATISTICS structure records statistical counters for the 802.11 interface.

## -struct-fields

### -field Header

The type, revision, and size of the DOT11_STATISTICS structure. This member is formatted as an
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.


The miniport driver must set the members of
     <b>Header</b> to the following values:





#### Type

This member must be set to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT.



#### Revision

This member must be set to DOT11_STATISTICS_REVISION_1.



#### Size

This member must be set to `sizeof(DOT11_STATISTICS)`.

For more information about these members, see
     <a href="..\ntddndis\ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header.md">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a>.

### -field ullFourWayHandshakeFailures

The number of four-way handshake failures that the 802.11 station encountered during Wi-Fi
     Protected Access (WPA) or Robust Security Network Association (RSNA) authentication.


If the 802.11 station is not performing the WPA or RSNA authentication, it should set this member to
     DOT11_STATISTICS_UNKNOWN.

### -field ullTKIPCounterMeasuresInvoked

The number of times that the 802.11 station invoked countermeasures following a message integrity
     code (MIC) failure.


If the 802.11 station is not performing TKIP countermeasures, it should set this member to
     DOT11_STATISTICS_UNKNOWN.

### -field ullReserved

This member is reserved for use by the operating system. The miniport driver must not write to
     this member.

### -field MacUcastCounters

The MAC layer counters based on unicast packets sent or received by the 802.11 station. The data
     structure for this member is the
     <a href="..\windot11\ns-windot11-dot11_mac_frame_statistics.md">
     DOT11_MAC_FRAME_STATISTICS</a> structure.


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <p class="note"> Counters for received unicast packets must only be incremented for those packets with a
     destination MAC address in the 802.11 MAC header that matches the 802.11 station's MAC
     address.</div>

### -field MacMcastCounters

The MAC layer counters based on multicast or broadcast packets sent or received by the 802.11
     station. The data structure for this member is the
     <a href="..\windot11\ns-windot11-dot11_mac_frame_statistics.md">
     DOT11_MAC_FRAME_STATISTICS</a> structure.


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <p class="note"> Counters for received multicast or broadcast packets must only be incremented for those
     packets with a destination MAC address in the 802.11 MAC header that matches an entry in the multicast
     address list of the 802.11 station. For more information about the multicast address list, see
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-dot11-multicast-list">OID_DOT11_MULTICAST_LIST</a>.</div>

### -field PhyCounters

An array of PHY layer counters. Each entry in this array is formatted as a
     <a href="..\windot11\ns-windot11-dot11_phy_frame_statistics.md">
     DOT11_PHY_FRAME_STATISTICS</a> structure.


The miniport driver must maintain an entry within the
     <b>PhyCounters</b> array for each supported PHY. If the 802.11 station supports multiple PHYs of the same
     type, the miniport driver must create separate entries for each.

Entries within the
     <b>PhyCounters</b> array must be in the same order as the list of supported PHYs that the driver returns
     when queried by
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-dot11-supported-phy-types">
     OID_DOT11_SUPPORTED_PHY_TYPES</a>.

## -syntax

```cpp
typedef struct DOT11_STATISTICS {
  NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER         Header;
  ULONGLONG                  ullFourWayHandshakeFailures;
  ULONGLONG                  ullTKIPCounterMeasuresInvoked;
  ULONGLONG                  ullReserved;
  DOT11_MAC_FRAME_STATISTICS MacUcastCounters;
  DOT11_MAC_FRAME_STATISTICS MacMcastCounters;
  DOT11_PHY_FRAME_STATISTICS PhyCounters[1];
} DOT11_STATISTICS, *PDOT11_STATISTICS;
```

## -remarks

The miniport driver must unconditionally set all of the counters in the DOT11_STATISTICS structure to
    zero, including MAC-layer and PHY-layer counters, when one of the following occurs:

<ul>
<li>
The driver's
      <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_initialize.md">MiniportInitializeEx</a> function is
      called.

</li>
<li>
The driver's
      <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-miniport_oid_request.md">MiniportOidRequest</a> function is
      called with an OID set request of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-dot11-reset-request">OID_DOT11_RESET_REQUEST</a>,
      regardless of the type of reset operation specified in the set request.

</li>
</ul>
