# VhfDelete function


## -description


The HID Source device driver calls this method to delete a VHF device.


## -parameters




### -param VhfHandle [in]

A handle to a virtual HID device that your HID source driver received in the previous call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/vhf/nf-vhf-vhfcreate">VhfCreate</a>.


### -param Wait [in]

TRUE to return synchronously after deleting a device. In this case, Virtual HID Framework (VHF) does not return until the device is reported as missing to PnP Manager and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/vhf/nc-vhf-evt_vhf_cleanup">EvtVhfCleanup</a> callback function returns. 

FALSE to return asynchronously. See Remarks for more information.


## -remarks



The HID source driver must stop initiating new requests for the Virtual HID Framework (VHF) just before calling <b>VhfDelete</b>. <b>VhfDelete</b> can be called synchronously or asynchronously.   

To call <b>VhfDelete</b> synchronously,  call it at PASSIVE_LEVEL with the <i>Wait</i> parameter set to TRUE. In this case, it returns synchronously after completing the deletion. If the HID source driver has registered an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/vhf/nc-vhf-evt_vhf_cleanup">EvtVhfCleanup</a> callback function with VHF, it invokes that callback before <b>VhfDelete</b> returns. The function might be invoked on the same thread.

To call <b>VhfDelete</b> asynchronously, call it at maximum DISPATCH_LEVEL. If you call it at DISPATCH_LEVEL, then <i>Wait</i> parameter must be set to FALSE, the function returns immediately. VHF invokes the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/vhf/nc-vhf-evt_vhf_cleanup">EvtVhfCleanup</a> callback at a later time after the deletion has completed. 

There are no restrictions on when a KMDF driver should call this function. It is recommended to call it from a function matching the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/vhf/nf-vhf-vhfcreate">VhfCreate</a> call. For example, if <b>VhfCreate</b> is called from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add">EvtDriverDeviceAdd</a>, then call <b>VhfDelete</b> synchronously from <i>EvtDeviceCleanupCallback</i>.
