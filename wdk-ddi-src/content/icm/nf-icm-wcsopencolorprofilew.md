# WcsOpenColorProfileW function


## -description

The **WcsOpenColorProfile** function creates a handle to a specified color profile.

## -parameters

### -param pCDMPProfile [in]

A pointer to a profile structure that specifies a WCS device model profile (DMP). The *pDMPProfile* pointer can be freed as soon as the handle is created.

### -param pCAMPProfile [in, optional]

A pointer to a profile structure that specifies a  WCS color appearance model profile (CAMP). The *pCAMPProfile* pointer can be freed as soon as the handle is created. If **NULL**, the standard default CAMP is used, and the current user setting, WCS_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE_CURRENT_USER, is used while querying the default CAMP.

### -param pGMMPProfile [in, optional]

A pointer to a profile structure that specifies a WCS gamut map model profile (GMMP). The *pGMMPProfile* pointer can be freed as soon as the handle is created. If **NULL**, the default GMMP for the default rendering intent is used, and the current user setting, WCS_PROFILE_MANAGEMENT_SCOPE_CURRENT_USER, is used while querying the default GMMP. For a description of rendering intents, see [Rendering Intents](/previous-versions//ms536520(v=vs.85)).

### -param dwDesireAccess [in]

A flag value that specifies how to access the given color profile. This parameter must take one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| PROFILE_READ | Specifies that the color profile will be opened for read-only access. |
| PROFILE_READWRITE | Specifies that the color profile will be opened for both read and write access.  This flag value is ignored when a WCS profile is opened. |

### -param dwShareMode 

[in]
A flag value that specifies actions to take while opening a color profile if it is contained in a file. This parameter must take one of the following values, which are defined in winnt.h:

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| FILE_SHARE_READ | Specifies that other open operations can be performed on the profile for read access. |
| FILE_SHARE_WRITE | Specifies that other open operations can be performed on the profile for write access. This flag value is ignored when a WCS profile is opened. |

### -param dwCreationMode 

[in]
A flag value that specifies actions to take while opening a color profile if it is contained in a file. This parameter must take one of the following values, which are defined in winbase.h:

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| CREATE_NEW | Specifies that a new profile is to be created. The function fails if the profile already exists. |
| CREATE_ALWAYS | Specifies that a new profile is to be created. If a profile already exists, it is overwritten. |
| OPEN_EXISTING | Specifies that the profile is to be opened. The function fails if the profile does not exist. |
| OPEN_ALWAYS | Specifies that the profile is to be opened if an International Color Consortium (ICC) file exists. If an ICC profile does not exist, WCS creates a new ICC profile. The function will fail for WCS profiles if this flag is set and a WCS profile does not exist. |
| TRUNCATE_EXISTING | Specifies that the profile is to be opened and truncated to zero bytes. The function fails if the profile does not exist. |

### -param dwFlags [in]

A flag value that specifies whether to use the embedded WCS profile. This parameter has no effect unless *pCDMProfile* specifies an ICC profile that contains an embedded WCS profile.This parameter takes one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| 0 | Specifies that the embedded WCS profile will be used and the ICC profile specfied by pCDMPProfile will be ignored. |
| DONT_USE_EMBEDDED_WCS_PROFILES | Specifies that the ICC profile specified by pCDMPProfile will be used and the embedded WCS profile will be ignored. |

## -remarks

The handle returned by this function can be used in other color profile management functions.

The compiler setting also determines the function version. If Unicode is defined, the function call resolves to **WcsOpenColorProfileW**. Otherwise, the function call resolves to **WcsOpenColorProfileA** because ANSI strings are being used.

If the color profile data is not specified using a file name, the *dwShareMode* and *dwCreationMode* values are ignored.

This function initially attempts to open the profile as an ICC profile. Even if a WCS profile is provided, the PROFILE_READWRITE and FILE_SHARE_WRITE flags are not ignored. However, if the provided profile is not an ICC profile (and a new ICC profile is not being created), these flag values are ignored.

The *dwCreationMode* flags CREATE_NEW, CREATE_ALWAYS, and TRUNCATE_EXISTING will always return an empty handle to the ICC color profile.

Once the handle to the color profile is created, any information used to create that handle can be deleted.

Use the [CloseColorProfile](/previous-versions//ms536810(v=vs.85)) function to close an object handle returned by **WcsOpenColorProfile**.
