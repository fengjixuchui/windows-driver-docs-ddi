# IOCTL_PAR_SET_WRITE_ADDRESS IOCTL


##  Major Code:


[IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-device-control)


## -description

The IOCTL_PAR_SET_WRITE_ADDRESS request sets an extended capabilities port (ECP) or enhanced parallel port (EPP) write address (channel) for a parallel device. The parallel port bus driver queues this request on a work queue for the parallel device.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

The <b>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> member points to a UCHAR buffer that the client allocates to input a write address. The client sets the buffer to an ECP or EPP write address.

### -input-buffer-length

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to the size, in bytes, of a UCHAR.

### -output-buffer

None.

### -output-buffer-length

None.

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

The <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the generic status values returned by device control requests for parallel devices or to the following value:




**STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER**

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> is less than the size, in bytes, of a UCHAR.
