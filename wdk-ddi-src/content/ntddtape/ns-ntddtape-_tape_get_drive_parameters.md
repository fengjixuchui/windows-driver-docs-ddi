# _TAPE_GET_DRIVE_PARAMETERS structure


## -description


The TAPE_GET_DRIVE_PARAMETERS structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddtape/ni-ntddtape-ioctl_tape_get_drive_params">IOCTL_TAPE_GET_DRIVE_PARAMS</a> request to retrieve information about capabilities of the tape drive.


## -struct-fields




### -field ECC

When set to <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the device uses hardware error correction.


### -field Compression

When set to <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that compression is enabled on a device that supports it. When compression is enabled, the device compresses data prior to writing it. When set to <b>FALSE</b>, compression is not enabled on the device. 


### -field DataPadding

When set to <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that data padding is enabled on a device that supports it. When padding is enabled, the device pads data with zeros to keep the tape streaming until data is ready. When set to <b>FALSE</b>, data padding is not enabled. 


### -field ReportSetmarks

When set to <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that reporting setmarks is enabled on a device that supports it. The device reports setmarks encountered during read or space operations. When set to <b>FALSE</b>, reporting setmarks is not enabled. 


### -field DefaultBlockSize

Indicates the default block size, in bytes. 


### -field MaximumBlockSize

Indicates the maximum block size, in bytes, of either the tape device or the underlying host bus adapter (HBA), whichever is smaller. 


### -field MinimumBlockSize

Indicates the minimum block size, in bytes. 


### -field MaximumPartitionCount

Indicates the maximum number of partitions the device supports. 


### -field FeaturesLow

Indicates the features supported by this drive. The miniport driver sets TAPE_DRIVE_<i>XXX</i> flags for features supported by the drive and clears flags for features not supported. Callers can use the TAPE_DRIVE_<i>XXX</i> masks defined in <i>minitape.h</i> to determine whether a drive supports a particular feature. The masks available are as follows:
