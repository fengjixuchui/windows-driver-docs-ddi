# _TAPE_WMI_OPERATIONS structure


## -description


The tape miniclass driver passes this structure to its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/minitape/nc-minitape-tape_process_command_routine">TapeMiniWMIControl</a> routine to indicate which WMI operation must be performed by the device. 


## -struct-fields




### -field Method

Indicates the operation to be performed by the tape device. The operations allowed are as follows:





#### TAPE_CHECK_FOR_DRIVE_PROBLEM

If the tape drive supports commands to return specific device errors, such as tape alerts, the minidriver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/minitape/nc-minitape-tape_process_command_routine">TapeMiniWMIControl</a> routine should execute the TAPE_QUERY_DEVICE_ERROR_DATA method Otherwise, it should execute the TAPE_QUERY_IO_ERROR_DATA method.





#### TAPE_QUERY_DEVICE_ERROR_DATA

Returns specific device errors, such as tape alerts. Not all tape drives support this method.





#### TAPE_QUERY_IO_ERROR_DATA

Returns general I/O error data, such as read/write errors, based on the I/O error count. All tape drives support this method.


### -field DataBufferSize

Indicates the size in bytes of the buffer in which the tape minidriver returns the results of the operation. 


### -field DataBuffer

Pointer to a buffer in which the tape minidriver returns the results of the operation. The first <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG) bytes of <b>DataBuffer</b> contain a value of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddtape/ne-ntddtape-_tape_drive_problem_type">TAPE_DRIVE_PROBLEM_TYPE</a>, followed by <b>DataBufferSize</b> - <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG) bytes of tape data. 


##### - Method.TAPE_CHECK_FOR_DRIVE_PROBLEM

If the tape drive supports commands to return specific device errors, such as tape alerts, the minidriver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/minitape/nc-minitape-tape_process_command_routine">TapeMiniWMIControl</a> routine should execute the TAPE_QUERY_DEVICE_ERROR_DATA method Otherwise, it should execute the TAPE_QUERY_IO_ERROR_DATA method.


##### - Method.TAPE_QUERY_DEVICE_ERROR_DATA

Returns specific device errors, such as tape alerts. Not all tape drives support this method.


##### - Method.TAPE_QUERY_IO_ERROR_DATA

Returns general I/O error data, such as read/write errors, based on the I/O error count. All tape drives support this method.
