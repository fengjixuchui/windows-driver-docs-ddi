# VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel function


## -description


The <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> function acquires a spin lock when the caller is already running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.


## -parameters




### -param HwDeviceExtension [in, out]

Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.


### -param SpinLock [in]

Pointer to a memory location that contains the spin lock.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



Miniport drivers call <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> instead of <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570175">VideoPortAcquireSpinLock</a> for better driver performance if and only if they are already running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.

If a miniport driver is running at IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL, it should call <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLock</b> to have IRQL raised by that routine. <b>VideoPortAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</b> requires the caller to be running already at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL, so no raise is necessary.

The caller should release the spin lock with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff570358">VideoPortReleaseSpinLockFromDpcLevel</a> as quickly as possible.
