# _VIDEO_CHILD_STATE structure


## -description


The VIDEO_CHILD_STATE structure contains information about a child device and the state into which it should be placed.


## -struct-fields




### -field Id

Specifies the ID for a particular child device, as given to it by the miniport driver. This value is the same as that returned in the <i>UId</i> parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/video/nc-video-pvideo_hw_get_child_descriptor">HwVidGetVideoChildDescriptor</a> function.


### -field State

Specifies the new state, on or off, for the child device. A value of one (1) indicates that the child device should be turned on; a value of zero (0) indicates that it should be turned off. One possible use for <b>State</b> is in hotkey switching from one display device to another.


## -remarks



One member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/video/ns-video-_video_child_state_configuration">VIDEO_CHILD_STATE_CONFIGURATION</a> structure is an array of VIDEO_CHILD_STATE structures. Each of these structures maintains state information for one of an adapter's child devices.
