# _VP_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION structure


## -description

The VP_DEVICE_DESCRIPTION structure describes the attributes of the physical device for which a driver is requesting a DMA object.

## -struct-fields

### -field ScatterGather

If <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the device supports scatter/gather DMA. If <b>FALSE</b>, the device does not support scatter/gather DMA.

### -field Dma32BitAddresses

If <b>TRUE</b>, specifies that 32-bit addresses are being used for DMA operations.

### -field Dma64BitAddresses

If <b>TRUE</b>, specifies that 64-bit addresses are being used for DMA operations.

### -field MaximumLength

Specifies the maximum number of bytes the device can handle in each DMA operation.

## -remarks

This structure is available in Windows XP and later.
