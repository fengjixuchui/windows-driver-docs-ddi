# _VIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET structure


## -description

A pointer to a VIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET structure is passed to the miniport driver's <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/video/nc-video-pvideo_hw_start_io">HwVidStartIO</a> function by the video port driver. The video port driver sets up the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/">VRP</a> from the IRP code (see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-major-function-codes">IRP Major Function Codes</a>) sent in response to a GDI call to <a href="/windows/win32/api/winddi/nf-winddi-engdeviceiocontrol">EngDeviceIoControl</a>. Usually, the corresponding display driver makes the call to <b>EngDeviceIoControl</b> when it needs support from the video port-miniport driver pair. The video port driver calls the miniport driver with the <i>VRP</i> to process the given IOCTL_VIDEO_<i>XXX</i> request.

## -struct-fields

### -field IoControlCode

Specifies an IOCTL_VIDEO_<i>XXX</i> value passed to the <b>EngDeviceIoControl</b> function by the caller and sent to the video port driver in an IRP code. For more information about the set of system-defined IOCTL_VIDEO_<i>XXX</i> that miniport drivers must support, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index">Video Miniport Driver I/O Control Codes</a>.

### -field StatusBlock

Pointer to a STATUS_BLOCK structure in the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/">VRP</a>. <b>StatusBlock</b> is filled in by the miniport driver with return information upon completion of each VRP.

### -field InputBuffer

Pointer to an input buffer that contains information passed in by the caller. The structure for the data depends on the value of <b>IoControlCode</b>. This member actually points to the same buffer as that indicated by <b>OutputBuffer</b>.

### -field InputBufferLength

Specifies the size in bytes of the input buffer.

### -field OutputBuffer

Pointer to an output buffer into which the miniport driver transfers data to be returned to the caller. The structure for the data depends on the value of <b>IoControlCode.</b> Because this member points to the same buffer as <b>InputBuffer</b>, a miniport driver must not write output in the <b>OutputBuffer</b> before it has consumed all input data from the <b>InputBuffer</b>.

### -field OutputBufferLength

Specifies the size in bytes of the output buffer. A miniport driver cannot enlarge this buffer. A miniport driver should set the <b>Status</b> member of the <b>StatusBlock</b> with ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER or ERROR_MORE_DATA if the given <b>OutputBuffer</b> is too small to contain all the returned information.
