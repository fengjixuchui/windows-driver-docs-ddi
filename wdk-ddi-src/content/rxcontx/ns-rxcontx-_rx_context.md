# _RX_CONTEXT structure


## -description

The RX_CONTEXT structure encapsulates an IRP for use by RDBSS, network mini-redirectors, and the file system. The RX_CONTEXT structure describes an IRP while it is being processed by a network mini-redirector and contains state information that allows global resources to be released as the IRP is completed.

## -struct-fields

### -field NodeTypeCode

The unique node type used for an RX_CONTEXT structure. All of the major structure types (RX_CONTEXT, SRV_CALL, NET_ROOT, V_NET_ROOT, SRV_OPEN, FCB, and FOBX, for example) used by RDBSS have a unique two-byte node type code defined in the <i>nodetype.h</i> include file which can be used for debugging. RDBSS sets this member to RDBSS_NTC_RX_CONTEXT when an RX_CONTEXT is initialized in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/rxcontx/nf-rxcontx-rxinitializecontext">RxInitializeContext</a> routine. If a network mini-redirector driver initializes an RX_CONTEXT structure using some other method, this member must be set.

RDBSS defines this member as part of a standard header for all structures used by RDBSS.

### -field NodeByteSize

The size, in bytes, of this structure. RDBSS sets this member to sizeof( RX_CONTEXT) when an RX_CONTEXT is initialized in the <b>RxInitializeContext</b> routine. If a network mini-redirector driver initializes an RX_CONTEXT structure using some other method, this member must be set.

RDBSS defines this member as part of a standard header for all structures used by RDBSS.

### -field ReferenceCount

The reference count for this structure after it is allocated. RDBSS sets this member to 1 when an RX_CONTEXT is allocated and initialized in the <b>RxInitializeContext</b> routine. If a network mini-redirector driver initializes an RX_CONTEXT structure using some other method, this member must be set.

RDBSS defines this member as part of a standard header for all structures used by RDBSS.

### -field ContextListEntry

The list entry to connect this RX_CONTEXT to the list of active RX_CONTEXTS.

### -field MajorFunction

The major function for the IRP encapsulated by this RX_CONTEXT.

### -field MinorFunction

The minor function for the IRP encapsulated by this RX_CONTEXT.

### -field PendingReturned

If set to <b>TRUE</b>, this specifies that RDBSS or a driver has marked the IRP pending. Each <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-io_completion_routine">IoCompletion</a> routine should check the value of this flag. If the flag is <b>TRUE</b>, and if the <b>IoCompletion</b> routine will not return STATUS_MORE_PROCESSING_REQUIRED, the routine should call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iomarkirppending">IoMarkIrpPending</a> to propagate the pending status to drivers above it in the device stack. This member is similar to the same field in the IRP. 

RDBSS always sets this member to <b>TRUE</b> before calling the network mini-redirector driver.

### -field PostRequest

If set to <b>TRUE</b>, this indicates if the associated request is to be posted to a RDBSS worker thread. A network mini-redirector can set this member to <b>TRUE</b> to indicate that it wants to post this request to the file system process (FSP).

### -field RealDevice

A pointer to the device object for the target network mini-redirector driver.

#### - ( unnamed struct )

 



#### StoredStatus

A member of an unnamed union used to return status information by a network mini-redirector driver for low I/O operations. RDBSS also sets this value based on the status returned by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/mrxqueryfileinfo">MRxQueryFileInfo</a> routine when the file query operation is not understood by RDBSS.



#### StoredStatusAlignment

A member of an unnamed union used to force proper alignment on the <b>StoredStatus</b> member. 



#### InformationToReturn

A member of an unnamed union used to return status information by a network mini-redirector driver for some low I/O (read, write, FSCTL, etc.) and <b>MrxQueryXXX</b> operations. 

The unique node type used for an RX_CONTEXT structure. All of the major structure types (RX_CONTEXT, SRV_CALL, NET_ROOT, V_NET_ROOT, SRV_OPEN, FCB, and FOBX, for example) used by RDBSS have a unique two-byte node type code defined in the <i>nodetype.h</i> include file which can be used for debugging. RDBSS sets this member to RDBSS_NTC_RX_CONTEXT when an RX_CONTEXT is initialized in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/rxcontx/nf-rxcontx-rxinitializecontext">RxInitializeContext</a> routine. If a network mini-redirector driver initializes an RX_CONTEXT structure using some other method, this member must be set.

RDBSS defines this member as part of a standard header for all structures used by RDBSS. 



#### FlagsForLowIo

A set of options set by RDBSS and passed to low I/O operations sent to the network mini-redirector. <b>FlagsForLowIo</b> is a member of unnamed structure used for low I/O requests to the network mini-redirector.



#### LowIoContext

A pointer to a LOWIO_CONTEXT structure passed to the network mini-redirector. <b>LowIoContext</b> is a member of unnamed structure used for low I/O requests sent to the network mini-redirector.


#### - FsdUid

The effective user ID if <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mrx/nf-mrx-rxstartminirdr">RxStartMinirdr</a> was called using a user-mode process thread. This member is not used by RDBSS.

## -remarks

The RX_CONTEXT structure is one of the fundamental data structures used by RDBSS and network mini-redirectors to manage an I/O request packet (IRP). The RX_CONTEXT data structure encapsulates an IRP for use by RDBSS, network mini-redirectors, and the file system. An RX_CONTEXT structure includes a pointer to a single IRP and all of the context required to process the IRP. 

An RX_CONTEXT structure is sometimes referred to as an IRP Context or RxContext in the Window Driver Kit (WDK) or IFS Kit header files and other resources used for developing network mini-redirector drivers.

The RX_CONTEXT is a data structure to which additional information provided by the various network mini redirectors is attached. The RX_CONTEXT includes fields for over allocating the size of each RX_CONTEXT structure by a pre-specified amount for each network mini redirector, which is then reserved for use by the mini redirector. This approach consists of allocating a pre-specified area, which is the same for all network mini redirectors as part of each RX_CONTEXT. This is an unformatted area on top of which any desired structure can be imposed by the various network mini redirectors. Developers of network mini-redirector drivers should try and define the associated private context to fit into this pre-specified area defined in the RX_CONTEXT data structure. Network mini-redirector drivers that violate this rule will incur a significant performance penalty.

Many RDBSS routines and routines exported by a network mini-redirector make reference to RX_CONTEXT structures in either the initiating thread or in some other thread used by the routine. Thus, allocated RX_CONTEXT structures are reference counted to manage their use for asynchronous operations. When the reference count goes to zero, the allocated RX_CONTEXT structure can be finalized and released on the last dereference operation.

RDBSS provides a number of routines that are used to manipulate an RX_CONTEXT and the associated IRP. These routines are used to allocate, initialize, and delete an RX_CONTEXT. These routines are also used to complete the IRP associated with an RX_CONTEXT and set up a cancel routine for an RX_CONTEXT.
