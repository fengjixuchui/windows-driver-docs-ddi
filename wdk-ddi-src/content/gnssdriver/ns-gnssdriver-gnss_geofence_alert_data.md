# GNSS_GEOFENCE_ALERT_DATA structure


## -description


This structure is used by the GNSS engine to notify a geofence breach alert.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

Structure size.


### -field Version

Version number.


### -field GeofenceID

The ID of the geofence. This ID was generated by the GNSS engine during creation of the geofence.


### -field GeofenceState

The new state of the geofence. The alert implies transitioning to this state.


### -field FixBasicData

The fix used to determine the geofence breach. Instead of the full set of fix data, a smaller subset contained in this field and the  FixAccuracyData field is expected.


### -field FixAccuracyData

The fix used to determine the geofence breach. Instead of the full set of fix data, a smaller subset contained in this field and the  FixBasicData field is expected.


### -field Unused

 




#### - Unused[512]
