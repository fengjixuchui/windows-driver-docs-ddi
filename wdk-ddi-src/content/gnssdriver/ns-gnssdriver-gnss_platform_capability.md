# GNSS_PLATFORM_CAPABILITY structure


## -description


This structure is used to communicate the platform/HLOS capabilities to the underlying GNSS driver.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

Structure size.


### -field Version

Version number.


### -field SupportAgnssInjection

Indicates that the platform supports AGNSS injection via the location platform.


### -field AgnssFormatSupported

Specifies a bitmask containing the different AGNSS formats (GNSS_AGNSSFORMAT_*) that the GNSS driver or device supports.


### -field Unused

 




#### - Reserved

Reserved for future use.


#### - Unused[512]

Padding buffer.


## -remarks



 This is a list of individual capability support of the GNSS adapter. The platform capability is represented in the same way as the device capabilities are represented.
