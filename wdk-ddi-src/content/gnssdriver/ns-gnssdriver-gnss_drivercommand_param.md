# GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_PARAM structure


## -description


This structure is used to send a command to the GNSS driver.

The command may involve configuring certain parameters and state variables of the underlying GNSS driver or device, or executing certain defined actions through the driver.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

Structure size.


### -field Version

Version number.


### -field CommandType

Identifies the specific command that the driver is required to execute.

This is a well-defined list of GNSS driver commands, as defined by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/gnssdriver/ne-gnssdriver-gnss_drivercommand_type">GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_TYPE</a> enumeration.


### -field Reserved

 


### -field CommandDataSize

Size of the configuration data being sent to the driver.


### -field Unused

 


### -field CommandData

 




#### - CommandData[ANYSIZE_ARRAY]

Data associated with the specific command type.

The driver must cast this buffer to the appropriate data type depending on the specific command.


#### - CommandFlag

Bitmask indicating certain aspects of the command.

The flags are defined by the GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_FLAG_* macro.


#### - Unused[512]

Padding buffer.
