# GNSS_GEOFENCES_TRACKINGSTATUS_DATA structure


## -description


This structure is used by the GNSS engine to notify of any changes in the tracking status while tracking a set of previously created geofences.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

Structure size.


### -field Version

Version number.


### -field Status

A failure code indicates that the GNSS engine is unable to track the geofences (due to bad signal conditions or other transient errors).

A success code indicates that the GNSS engine was previously unable to track geofences, and is now able to track them.


### -field StatusTimeStamp

The UTC time of this status.


### -field Unused

 




#### - Unused[512]

Padding buffer.


## -remarks



The GNSS engine must not raise  events when it is not tracking any mobile-originated geofences (but tracking network-initiated Geofences), or when the geofence tracking has been reset by the GNSS_ResetGeofenceTracking command.
