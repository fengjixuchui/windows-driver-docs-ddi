# GNSS_LKGFIX_PARAM structure


## -description


This structure is not used currently by the system and is not required to be implemented.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

Structure size.


### -field Version

Version number.


## -remarks



No additional parameter is needed for an LKG fix. The GNSS adapter implements any aging heuristics for rejecting an LKG fix received from the GNSS driver based on the difference between the fix time and current time.
