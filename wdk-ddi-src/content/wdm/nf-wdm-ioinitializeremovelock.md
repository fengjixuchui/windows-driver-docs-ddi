# IoInitializeRemoveLock macro


## -description


The <b>IoInitializeRemoveLock</b> routine initializes a remove lock for a device object.


## -parameters




### -param Lock [in]

Pointer to a caller-supplied <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure that this routine initializes with information about the lock, including a counter and a synchronization event. A driver writer must allocate this structure as part of the device object's device extension.

### -param Tag [in]

Specifies a tag to identify the creator of the lock. Driver writers typically use a 4-character string, specified in reverse order, like the tags used for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag">ExAllocatePoolWithTag</a>.

The I/O system uses this parameter if <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/what-s-new-in-driver-development">Driver Verifier</a> is enabled, and on checked builds regardless of whether Driver Verifier is enabled. The caller should always supply a nonzero tag value for this parameter, for both free and checked builds.

### - param Maxmin [in]

Specifies the maximum number of minutes that this lock should be held. A value of zero means there is no limit. This value is typically used during debugging to identify a driver routine that holds the lock longer than expected.

The I/O system uses this parameter if Driver Verifier is enabled, and on checked builds regardless of whether Driver Verifier is enabled. If the lock is held for more than <i>MaxLockedMinutes</i> on a checked build, the operating system asserts.

### - param HighWater [in]

Specifies the maximum number of outstanding acquisitions allowed on the lock. Use 0 to specify no maximum. <i>HighWatermark</i> must be <= 0x7FFFFFFF.

The I/O system uses this parameter if Driver Verifier is enabled, and on checked builds regardless of whether Driver Verifier is enabled. If the lock is acquired <i>HighWatermark</i> times on a checked build, the operating system asserts.



## -remarks



A driver can use a remove lock to track outstanding I/O operations on a device and to determine when the driver can delete its device object in response to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-remove-device">IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request.

Before calling <b>IoInitializeRemoveLock</b>, a driver should allocate an <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/device-extensions">device extension</a>. A driver typically calls <b>IoInitializeRemoveLock</b> in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_add_device">AddDevice</a> routine, when the driver initializes the rest of the device extension for a device object.

After the <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> routine returns, the driver should consider the device to be in a state in which it is ready to be removed and cannot perform I/O operations. Therefore, the driver must not call <b>IoInitializeRemoveLock</b> to re-initialize the remove lock. Violation of this rule while the driver is being verified by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/what-s-new-in-driver-development">Driver Verifier</a> will result in a bug check.

Because the driver stores the <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure in the device extension of a device object, the remove lock is deleted when the driver deletes the device extension as part of processing an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-remove-device">IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request.
