# _FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION structure


## -description


The <b>FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION</b> structure provides extended attribute (EA) information. This structure is used primarily by network drivers.


## -struct-fields




### -field NextEntryOffset

The offset of the next <b>FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION</b>-type entry. This member is zero if no other entries follow this one. 


### -field Flags

Can be zero or can be set with FILE_NEED_EA, indicating that the file to which the EA belongs cannot be interpreted without understanding the associated extended attributes.


### -field EaNameLength

The length in bytes of the <b>EaName</b> array. This value does not include a null-terminator to <b>EaName</b>. 


### -field EaValueLength

The length in bytes of each EA value in the array.


### -field EaName

An array of characters naming the EA for this entry.


## -remarks



This structure is longword-aligned. If a set of <b>FILE_FULL_EA_INFORMATION</b> entries is buffered, <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on a longword boundary. 

The value(s) associated with each entry follows the <b>EaName</b> array. That is, an EA's values are located at <b>EaName</b> + (<b>EaNameLength</b> + 1).
