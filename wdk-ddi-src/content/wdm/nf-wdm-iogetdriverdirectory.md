# IoGetDriverDirectory function


## -description

Returns a handle to a directory on disk from which the driver can read and write files. The files in that directory apply to a specific driver object.

## -parameters

### -param DriverObject
[_In_] A pointer to the driver object ([**DRIVER_OBJECT**](ns-wdm-_driver_object.md) structure) of the calling driver.

### -param DirectoryType
[_In_] A [**_DRIVER_DIRECTORY_TYPE**](ne-wdm-_driver_directory_type.md)-type value that indicates the type of requested directory.

### -param Flags
[_In_] Must be 0.

### -param DriverDirectoryHandle
[_Out_] A pointer to a variable that receives a HANDLE to the requested driver directory. The caller must not pass NULL.

## -returns

Returns an appropriate [NTSTATUS value](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values). Possible values include:
| Error code               | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STATUS_SUCCESS           | The call successfully opened a handle to the requested driver directory.                           |
| STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | An input value to this function is invalid. For example, _DriverObject_ or _DriverDirectoryHandle_ is NULL;  _Flags_ is not 0. |

## -remarks
If **IoGetDriverDirectory** is called before the required disks and volumes have been started, the function does not open a handle and returns an error. 

Drivers typically use [**ZwOpenFile**](nf-wdm-zwopenfile.md) and [**ZwCreateFile**](nf-wdm-zwcreatefile.md) to access/create files. One of the parameters for those functions is an [**OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES**](https:://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_status_block) structure, which contains the object name and a root directory. If the root directory is NULL, then the object name must be a fully qualified path. However, if you provide a handle for the root directory, then the object name must be relative to the object (in the case of files, the directory), that the handle represents. 

After the **IoGetDriverDirectory** call succeeds, use the received HANDLE as a root directory in the [**OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES**](https:://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_status_block) that you are passing to a [**ZwOpenFile**](nf-wdm-zwopenfile.md) and [**ZwCreateFile**](nf-wdm-zwcreatefile.md).

The driver must call [**ZwClose**](nf-wdm-zwclose.md) to close the received handle when access is no longer required.

Callers of **IoGetDriverDirectory** must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL in the context of a system thread.
