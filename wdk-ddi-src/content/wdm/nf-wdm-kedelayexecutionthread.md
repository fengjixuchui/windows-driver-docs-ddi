# KeDelayExecutionThread function


## -description


The <b>KeDelayExecutionThread</b> routine puts the current thread into an alertable or nonalertable wait state for a specified interval. 


## -parameters




### -param WaitMode [in]

Specifies the processor mode in which the caller is waiting, which can be either <b>KernelMode</b> or <b>UserMode</b>. Lower-level drivers should specify <b>KernelMode</b>.


### -param Alertable [in]

Specifies <b>TRUE</b> if the wait is alertable. Lower-level drivers should specify <b>FALSE</b>.


### -param Interval [in]

Specifies the absolute or relative time, in units of 100 nanoseconds, for which the wait is to occur. A negative value indicates relative time. Absolute expiration times track any changes in system time; relative expiration times are not affected by system time changes.


## -returns



<b>KeDelayExecutionThread</b> returns one of the following values that describes how the delay was completed:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The delay completed because the specified interval elapsed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_ALERTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The delay completed because the thread was alerted.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_USER_APC</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
A user-mode APC was delivered before the specified <i>Interval </i>expired.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

Note that the NT_SUCCESS macro recognizes all of these status values as "success" values.




## -remarks



The expiration time is computed and the current thread is put in a wait state. When the specified interval has passed, the thread exits the wait state and is put in the ready state, becoming eligible for execution.

The <i>Alertable</i> parameter determines when the thread can be alerted and its wait state consequently aborted. For additional information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/waits-and-apcs">Waits and APCs</a>.

If the <i>WaitMode</i> parameter is <b>UserMode</b>, the kernel stack can be swapped out during the wait. Consequently, a caller must <u>never</u> attempt to pass parameters on the stack when calling <b>KeDelayExecutionThread</b> using the <b>UserMode</b> argument.

It is especially important to check the return value of <b>KeDelayExecutionThread</b> when the <i>WaitMode</i> parameter is <b>UserMode</b> or <i>Alertable</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, because <b>KeDelayExecutionThread</b> might return early with a status of STATUS_USER_APC or STATUS_ALERTED.

All long term waits that can be aborted by a user should be <b>UserMode</b> waits and <i>Alertable</i> should be set to <b>FALSE</b>.

Where possible, <i>Alertable</i> should be set to <b>FALSE</b> and <i>WaitMode</i> should be set to <b>KernelMode</b>, in order to reduce driver complexity. The principal exception to this guideline is when the wait is a long-term wait.

The expiration time of the delay is expressed as either an absolute time at which the delay is to expire, or a time relative to the current system time. If the <i>Interval</i> parameter value is positive, the expiration time is an absolute time. If this value is negative, the expiration time is a relative time.

Expiration times are measured relative to the system clock, and the accuracy with which the operating system can detect when a timer expires is limited by the granularity of the system clock. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/timer-accuracy">Timer Accuracy</a>.
