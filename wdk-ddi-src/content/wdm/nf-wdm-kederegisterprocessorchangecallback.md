# KeDeregisterProcessorChangeCallback function


## -description


The <b>KeDeregisterProcessorChangeCallback</b> routine unregisters a callback function that was previously registered with the operating system by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-keregisterprocessorchangecallback">KeRegisterProcessorChangeCallback</a> routine.


## -parameters




### -param CallbackHandle [in]

The callback registration handle that was returned by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-keregisterprocessorchangecallback">KeRegisterProcessorChangeCallback</a> routine when the callback function was registered with the operating system. 


## -remarks



A device driver calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-keregisterprocessorchangecallback">KeRegisterProcessorChangeCallback</a> routine to register a callback function with the operating system so that the operating system will notify the driver when a new processor is added to the hardware partition. When the device driver no longer needs to receive notification when new processors are added to the hardware paritition, it calls the <b>KeDeregisterProcessorChangeCallback</b> routine to unregister the callback function. A callback function that has been registered for notification of processor changes must be unregistered before the device driver is unloaded from the operating system.
