# _DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_V1 structure


## -description



The <b>DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_V1</b> structure describes the capabilities of the system DMA controller that is represented by an adapter object.




## -struct-fields




### -field ReadDmaCounterAvailable

Whether the counter value in each DMA channel can be read. This member is <b>TRUE</b> if the counter can be read, and is <b>FALSE</b> if it cannot be read.


### -field ScatterGatherLimit

The maximum number of elements in a scatter/gather list that the DMA controller can process in a single scatter/gather DMA transfer.


### -field DmaAddressWidth

The memory address width, in bits, of the DMA controller. The width is expressed as the number of bits in a DMA address. If the DMA address width is less than the memory address width, the platform hardware drives the remaining, high-order memory address bits to zero during a DMA transfer.


### -field Flags

A set of flags that describe the capabilities of the DMA adapter. No flags are currently defined for this member.


### -field MinimumTransferUnit

The size, in bytes, of the minimum transfer unit. The number of bytes specified by an element in a scatter/gather list must be an integer multiple of the minimum transfer unit.


## -remarks



The <b>V1</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_dma_adapter_info">DMA_ADAPTER_INFO</a> structure is a structure of type <b>DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_V1</b>.

A driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-pget_dma_adapter_info">GetDmaAdapterInfo</a> to obtain information about the hardware capabilities of a system DMA channel. <b>GetDmaAdapterInfo</b> writes this information into the <b>V1</b> member of a caller-supplied <b>DMA_ADAPTER_INFO</b> structure.
