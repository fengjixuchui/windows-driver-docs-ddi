# D3COLD_REQUEST_CORE_POWER_RAIL callback function


## -description

Enables the function device object (FDO) to indicate whether the core power rail is needed.

## -parameters

### -param Context

[_In_reads_opt_(_Inexpressible_("varies"))] The handle to the device.

### -param CorePowerRailNeeded: 

[_In_] A flag that indicates whether or not the driver needs the core power rail.

## -prototype

```cpp
//Declaration

D3COLD_REQUEST_CORE_POWER_RAIL D3coldRequestCorePowerRail; 

// Definition

VOID D3coldRequestCorePowerRail 
(
	PVOID Context
	BOOLEAN CorePowerRailNeeded
)
{...}

D3COLD_REQUEST_CORE_POWER_RAIL *PD3COLD_REQUEST_CORE_POWER_RAIL


```

## -remarks

A device driver that successfully queries for the GUID_D3COLD_AUX_POWER_AND_TIMING_INTERFACE interface receives a pointer to a [**D3COLD_AUX_POWER_AND_TIMING_INTERFACE**](ns-wdm-_d3cold_aux_power_and_timing_interface.md) structure in which the driver sets the **RequestCorePowerRail** member to a pointer to its implementation of the _D3COLD_REQUEST_CORE_POWER_RAIL_ callback function.

  - If the driver indicates that the core power rail is needed, it is
    guaranteed that the core power rail is turned on when this call returns.

  - When a driver indicates that the core power rail is no longer needed,
    there is no guarantee of the core power rail state onwards.

  - This routine can never fail.
