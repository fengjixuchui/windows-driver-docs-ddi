# KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount function


## -description


The <b>KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount</b> routine returns the maximum number of processors.


## -returns



<b>KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount</b> returns the maximum number of processors as a ULONG value.




## -remarks



The value returned by the <b>KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount</b> routine does not change at runtime.

If your code uses an array of buffers, one buffer for each processor, you must decide whether to have a statically sized array based on <b>KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount</b> or a dynamically sized array based on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kequeryactiveprocessorcount">KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</a>.

To optimize based on the number of processors, you need a resizable structure for Windows Server 2008. In this case, use <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b>.

If you are not optimizing and if the data structures that result from using maximum processor count are relatively small, a resizable structure is not necessary. In this case, use <b>KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount</b> to determine size for a static array.

Windows 7 and later versions of Windows support processor groups. Drivers that are designed to handle information about processor groups should use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-kequerymaximumprocessorcountex">KeQueryMaximumProcessorCountEx</a> routine, which specifies a processor group, instead of <b>KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount</b>, which does not. However, the implementation of <b>KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount</b> in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows provides compatibility for drivers that were written for earlier versions of Windows, which do not support processor groups. In this implementation, <b>KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount</b> returns the maximum number of logical processors that can be in group 0.
