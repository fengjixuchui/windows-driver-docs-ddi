# KeReleaseSpinLock macro


## -description


The <b>KeReleaseSpinLock</b> routine releases a spin lock and restores the original IRQL at which the caller was running.

## -syntax

```cpp
VOID
KeReleaseSpinLock (
    _Inout_ PKSPIN_LOCK SpinLock,
    _In_ _IRQL_restores_ KIRQL NewIrql
    );
```

## -parameters




### -param SpinLock [in]

Pointer to a KSPIN_LOCK spin lock for which the caller provides the storage.


### -param NewIrql [in, out]

Specifies the KIRQL value saved from the preceding call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-keacquirespinlock">KeAcquireSpinLock</a>.





## -remarks



This call is a reciprocal to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-keacquirespinlock">KeAcquireSpinLock</a>. The input <i>NewIrql</i> value must be the <i>OldIrql</i> returned by <b>KeAcquireSpinLock</b>.

For more information about spin locks, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/spin-locks">Spin Locks</a>.

Callers of this routine are running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. On return from <b>KeReleaseSpinLock</b>, IRQL is restored to the <i>NewIrql</i> value.
