# _MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST structure


## -description


The <b>MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST</b> structure specifies a range of physical addresses.


## -struct-fields




### -field PhysicalAddress

The starting physical address of the range. This address must be aligned to a page boundary in physical memory.


### -field NumberOfBytes

The number of bytes in the range. This member must be nonzero and an integer multiple of the memory page size.


## -remarks



The first parameter to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-mmallocatemdlforiospace">MmAllocateMdlForIoSpace</a> routine is a pointer to an array of <b>MM_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS_LIST</b> structures.
