# ExReleaseSpinLockExclusive function


## -description


The <b>ExReleaseSpinLockExclusive</b> routine releases a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks">spin lock</a> that the caller previously acquired for exclusive access, and restores the IRQL to its original value.


## -parameters




### -param param [in, out]

 A pointer to the spin lock to release. The caller must own this spin lock for exclusive access.


### -param OldIrql [in]

The interrupt request level (IRQL) to restore. Set this parameter to the KIRQL value that was returned by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/hh451007(v=vs.85)">ExAcquireSpinLockExclusive</a> call that acquired the spin lock.


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



This routine must be called only for a spin lock that is owned by the caller.

On entry to this routine, the caller must be running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL. Before exiting, <b>ExReleaseSpinLockExclusive</b> restores the IRQL to the value specified by the <i>OldIrql</i> parameter.

The caller should hold the spin lock only briefly before releasing it. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks">Introduction to Spin Locks</a>.
