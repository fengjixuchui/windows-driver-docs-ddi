# RtlCopyMemory macro


## -description


The <b>RtlCopyMemory</b> routine copies the contents of a source memory block to a destination memory block.


## -parameters




### -param Destination [out]

Datatype: void*. A pointer to the destination memory block to copy the bytes to.


### -param Source [in]

Datatype: const void*. A pointer to the source memory block to copy the bytes from.


### -param Length [in]

Datatype: size_t. The number of bytes to copy from the source to the destination.


## -remarks



<b>RtlCopyMemory</b> runs faster than <b>RtlMoveMemory</b>. However, <b>RtlCopyMemory</b> requires that the source memory block, which is defined by <i>Source</i> and <i>Length</i>, cannot overlap the destination memory block, which is defined by <i>Destination</i> and <i>Length</i>. In contrast, <b>RtlMoveMemory</b> correctly handles the case in which the source and destination memory blocks overlap.

New drivers should use the <b>RtlCopyMemory</b> routine instead of <b>RtlCopyBytes</b>.

Callers of <b>RtlCopyMemory</b> can be running at any IRQL if the source and destination memory blocks are in nonpaged system memory. Otherwise, the caller must be running at IRQL <= APC_LEVEL.
