# IoAcquireRemoveLock macro


## -description


The <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b> routine increments the count for a remove lock, 
   indicating that the associated device object should not be detached from the device stack or deleted.

## -syntax

```cpp
NTSTATUS
IoAcquireRemoveLock (
    _Inout_ PIO_REMOVE_LOCK RemoveLock,
    _In_opt_ PVOID          Tag
    );
```

## -parameters




### -param RemoveLock [in]

Pointer to an <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure that the caller initialized with a 
      previous call to 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioinitializeremovelock">IoInitializeRemoveLock</a>.


### -param Tag [in, optional]

Optionally points to a caller-supplied tag that identifies this instance of acquiring the remove lock. For 
       example, a driver Dispatch routine typically sets this parameter to a pointer to the IRP the routine is 
       processing.

If a driver specifies a <i>Tag</i> on a call to 
       <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b>, the driver must supply the same 
       <i>Tag</i> in the corresponding call to 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioreleaseremovelock">IoReleaseRemoveLock</a>.

The <i>Tag</i> does not have to be unique, but should be something meaningful during 
       debugging.


## -remarks

This macro wraps and assumes the return value of **IoAcquireRemoveLockEx**, which is NTSTATUS.

**IoAcquireRemoveLock** returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. One possible error return value is the following:

STATUS_DELETE_PENDING: The driver has received an IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE for the device and has called IoReleaseRemoveLockandWait. That routine is waiting for all remove locks to clear before returning control to the driver.

If the routine returns any value besides STATUS_SUCCESS, do not start any new operations on the device.




A driver must initialize a remove lock with a call to 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioinitializeremovelock">IoInitializeRemoveLock</a> before using the 
     lock.

A driver must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioreleaseremovelock">IoReleaseRemoveLock</a> to 
     release the lock when it is no longer needed.
