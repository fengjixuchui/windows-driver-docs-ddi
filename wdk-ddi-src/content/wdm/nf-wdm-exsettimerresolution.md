# ExSetTimerResolution function


## -description

The <b>ExSetTimerResolution</b> routine modifies the frequency at which the system clock interrupts. <u>Use this routine with extreme caution (see the following Remarks section).</u>

## -parameters

### -param DesiredTime 

[in]
Specifies the amount of time that should elapse between each timer interrupt, in 100-nanosecond units. The minimum value is approximately 10,000 (1 millisecond) but can vary slightly by platform. (This parameter is ignored if <i>SetResolution</i> is <b>FALSE</b>.)

### -param SetResolution 

[in]
If <b>TRUE</b>, the call is a request to set the clock interrupt frequency to the value specified by <i>DesiredTime</i>. If <b>FALSE</b>, the call is a request to restore the clock interrupt frequency to the system's default value, which is platform-specific.

## -returns

<b>ExSetTimerResolution</b> returns the new timer resolution, in 100-nanosecond units.

## -remarks

To set the timer resolution, a driver calls this routine passing <b>TRUE</b> as the parameter for <i>SetResolution</i>. The following rules apply:

<ul>
<li>
The routine changes the clock interrupt frequency <u>only</u> if the specified  <i>DesiredTime</i> value is less than the current setting.

</li>
<li>
If a driver requests a <i>DesiredTime</i> value that is greater than what is currently set, the routine just returns the current setting.

</li>
<li>
If a driver requests a <i>DesiredTime</i> value that is less than the system clock can support, the routine uses the smallest resolution the system can support, and returns that value.

</li>
</ul>
If you use this routine to change the clock interrupt frequency, your driver <u>must</u> restore the default interrupt frequency, typically by making the following call before being unloaded:


```
ExSetTimerResolution (0, FALSE);
```

(If multiple drivers have attempted to modify the clock interrupt frequency, the system does not restore the default frequency until all of these drivers have called this routine with a <i>SetResolution</i> value of <b>FALSE</b>.)

<u>Note that the result of changing the clock interrupt frequency is system-wide and can have a severely negative effect on system performance. Also note that higher clock interrupt frequencies can shorten a system's battery life.</u>

During the processing of an <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-power">IRP_MJ_POWER</a> request, the power manager holds a lock on a resource that <b>ExSetTimerResolution</b> must acquire to complete. Consequently, a deadlock will occur if a driver directly or indirectly calls <b>ExSetTimerResolution</b> while processing a power request, and then waits for the call to <b>ExSetTimerResolution</b> to return before the driver completes the power request. For more information about safely calling <b>ExSetTimerResolution</b> while processing a power IRP, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/calling-exsettimerresolution-while-processing-a-power-irp">Calling ExSetTimerResolution While Processing a Power IRP</a>.
