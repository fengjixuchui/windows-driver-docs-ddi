# KeCancelTimer function


## -description


The <b>KeCancelTimer</b> routine dequeues a timer object before the timer interval, if any was set, expires.


## -parameters




### -param Arg1 [in, out]

Pointer to an initialized timer object, for which the caller provides the storage.




## -returns



If the specified timer object is in the system timer queue, <b>KeCancelTimer</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>.




## -remarks



If the timer object is currently in the system timer queue, it is removed from the queue. If a DPC object is associated with the timer, it too is canceled. Otherwise, no operation is performed.

The routine returns <b>TRUE</b> if the timer is still in the timer queue. A nonperiodic timer is removed from the system queue as soon as it expires. Thus, for nonperiodic timers, <b>KeCancelTimer</b> returns <b>FALSE</b> if the timer DPC has been queued. Periodic timers are always in the timer queue, so <b>KeCancelTimer</b> always returns <b>TRUE</b> for periodic timers. 

Note that a DPC that is already running runs to completion. The driver must ensure that the DPC has completed before freeing any resources used by the DPC. For a nonperiodic timer, you can use synchronization primitives, such as event objects, to synchronize between the driver and the DPC. The driver can check the return code of <b>KeCancelTimer</b> to determine if the DPC is running. If so, the DPC can signal the event before exiting, and the driver can wait for that event to be reset to the not-signaled state.

Since for periodic timers <b>KeCancelTimer</b> always returns <b>TRUE</b>, drivers must use a different technique to wait until the DPC has completed. Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-keflushqueueddpcs">KeFlushQueuedDpcs</a> routine to block until the DPC executes.

Drivers do not need to synchronize for data stored in global variables or driver object extensions. The system automatically calls <b>KeFlushQueuedDpcs</b> before deallocating either of these regions.
