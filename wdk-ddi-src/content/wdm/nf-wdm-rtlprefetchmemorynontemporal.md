# RtlPrefetchMemoryNonTemporal function


## -description


The <b>RtlPrefetchMemoryNonTemporal</b> routine provides a hint to the processor that a buffer should be temporarily moved into the processor cache.


## -parameters




### -param Source [in]

A pointer to the buffer to be moved into the processor cache. 


### -param Length [in]

The length of the buffer to be moved. 


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



You should use this routine only for a buffer that will be written to or read from exactly once. Note that <b>RtlPrefetchMemoryNonTemporal</b> is only a hint to the processor: the buffer is not guaranteed to be moved into the cache. On x86-based and x64-based systems, this routine uses the <b>prefetchnta</b> instruction.
