# _D3COLD_LAST_TRANSITION_STATUS enumeration


## -description


The <b>D3COLD_LAST_TRANSITION_STATUS</b> enumeration indicates whether the most recent transition to the D3hot device power state was followed by a transition to the D3cold device power state.


## -enum-fields




### -field LastDStateTransitionStatusUnknown

Information is not available from the bus driver or platform firmware about whether the most recent transition to D3hot was followed by a transition to D3cold.


### -field LastDStateTransitionD3hot

The most recent transition to the D3hot device power state was not followed by a transition to the D3cold device power state.


### -field LastDStateTransitionD3cold

The most recent transition to the D3hot device power state was followed by a transition to the D3cold device power state.


## -remarks



The <i>LastTransitionStatus</i> parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-get_d3cold_last_transition_status">GetLastTransitionStatus</a> routine is a pointer to a variable of type <b>D3COLD_LAST_TRANSITION_STATUS</b>.
