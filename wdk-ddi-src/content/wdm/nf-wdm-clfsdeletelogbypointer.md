# ClfsDeleteLogByPointer function


## -description


The <b>ClfsDeleteLogByPointer</b> routine marks a CLFS stream for deletion. 


## -parameters




### -param plfoLog [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_file_object">LOG_FILE_OBJECT</a> structure that represents an open instance of the stream to be deleted. The caller previously obtained this pointer by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-clfscreatelogfile">ClfsCreateLogFile</a>.


## -returns



<b>ClfsDeleteLogByPointer</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds; otherwise, it returns one of the error codes defined in Ntstatus.h.




## -remarks



<b>ClfsDeleteLogByPointer</b> marks a stream for deletion but does not close the log file object pointed to by <i>plfoLog</i>. To close a log file object, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-clfscloselogfileobject">ClfsCloseLogFileObject</a>. A stream marked for deletion is deleted after all log file objects associated with the stream are closed.

A CLFS stream marked for deletion will refuse subsequent requests to open the stream.

For an explanation of CLFS concepts and terminology, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-common-log-file-system">Common Log File System</a>.
