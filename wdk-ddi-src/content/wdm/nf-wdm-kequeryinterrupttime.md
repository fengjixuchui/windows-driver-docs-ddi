# KeQueryInterruptTime function


## -description


The <b>KeQueryInterruptTime</b> routine returns the current value of the system <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=201082">interrupt time</a> count, with accuracy to within system clock tick.


## -returns



<b>KeQueryInterruptTime</b> returns the current interrupt-time count in 100-nanosecond units. The update to this return value generally occurs at least once per system clock tick.




## -remarks



This routine returns the system interrupt time, which is the amount of time since the operating system was last started. The interrupt-time count begins at zero when the operating system starts and is incremented at each clock interrupt by the length of a clock tick. For various reasons, such as hardware differences, the length of a system clock tick can vary between computers. Call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kequerytimeincrement">KeQueryTimeIncrement</a> routine to determine the size of a system clock tick.

<b>KeQueryInterruptTime</b> can be used for performance tuning. This routine returns a finer grained measurement than the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-kequerytickcount">KeQueryTickCount</a> routine. A call to <b>KeQueryInterruptTime</b> has considerably less overhead than a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-kequeryperformancecounter">KeQueryPerformanceCounter</a> routine, as well.

Consequently, interrupt time can be used to measure very fine-grained durations while the system is running because operations that set or reset the system time have no effect on the system interrupt time count.

However, power-management state changes do affect the system interrupt time count. Maintenance of the interrupt time count is suspended during system sleep states. When a subsequent wake state transition occurs, the system adds a "bias" value to the interrupt time count to compensate for the estimated duration of such a sleep state. The interrupt time count that is returned by <b>KeQueryInterruptTime</b> includes this bias value. To obtain an unbiased interrupt time count, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kequeryunbiasedinterrupttime">KeQueryUnbiasedInterruptTime</a> routine instead of <b>KeQueryInterruptTime</b>.
