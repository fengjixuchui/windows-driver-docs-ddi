## -description


The <b>WRITE_PORT_BUFFER_UCHAR</b> routine writes a number of bytes from a buffer to the specified port.


## -parameters




### -param Port [in]

Pointer to the port, which must be a mapped memory range in I/O space.


### -param Buffer [in]

Pointer to a buffer from which an array of UCHAR values is to be written.


### -param Count [in]

Specifies the number of bytes to be written to the port. 


## -returns



None




## -remarks



The size of the buffer must be large enough to contain at least the specified number of bytes.

Callers of <b>WRITE_PORT_BUFFER_UCHAR</b> can be running at any IRQL, assuming the <i>Buffer</i> is resident and the <i>Port</i> is resident, mapped device memory.
