# IoInvalidateDeviceState function


## -description

The <b>IoInvalidateDeviceState</b> routine notifies the PnP manager that some aspect of the PnP state of a device has changed.

## -parameters

### -param PhysicalDeviceObject 

[in]
Pointer to the PDO for the device.

## -remarks

Drivers call this routine to indicate that something has changed with respect to one of the following aspects of a device's PnP state:

PNP_DEVICE_DISABLED

PNP_DEVICE_DONT_DISPLAY_IN_UI

PNP_DEVICE_FAILED

PNP_DEVICE_NOT_DISABLEABLE

PNP_DEVICE_REMOVED

PNP_DEVICE_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_CHANGED

For descriptions of the preceding constants, see [PNP_DEVICE_STATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/handling-an-irp-mn-surprise-removal-request#about-pnpdevicestate).

In response to this routine, the PnP manager sends an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-query-pnp-device-state">IRP_MN_QUERY_PNP_DEVICE_STATE</a> request to the device stack, to determine the current PnP state of the device.
