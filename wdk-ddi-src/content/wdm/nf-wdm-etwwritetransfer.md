## -description


The <b>EtwWriteTransfer</b> function marks an event that links two activities together; this type of event is referred to as a <i>transfer event</i>. A transfer event can contain the same user-defined data, the same fields, and is subject to the same rules as other events. 


## -parameters




### -param RegHandle [in]

A pointer to the event provider registration handle, which is returned by the <b>EtwRegister</b> function if the event provider registration is successful.


### -param EventDescriptor [in]

A pointer to the EVENT_DESCRIPTOR structure. 


### -param ActivityId [in, optional]

The identifier that indicates the activity associated with the event. The <i>ActivityId</i> provides a way to group related events and is used in end-to-end tracing. This identifier is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param RelatedActivityId [in, optional]

The identifier that indicates related activity associated with the event. The <i>RelatedActivityID</i> provides a way to group related events and is used in end-to-end tracing. 


### -param UserDataCount [in]

The number of elements in an array of EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR structures. 


### -param UserData [in, optional]

## -returns



<b>EtwWriteTransfer</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the event was successfully published.




## -remarks



You can call <b>EtwWriteTransfer</b> at any IRQL. However, when IRQL is greater than APC_LEVEL, any data passed to the <b>EtwWrite</b>, <b>EtwWriteString</b>, <b>EtwWriteTransfer</b> functions must not be pageable. That is, any kernel-mode routine that is running at IRQL greater than APC_LEVEL cannot access pageable memory. Data passed to the <b>EtwWrite</b>, <b>EtwWriteString</b>, <b>EtwWriteTransfer</b> functions must reside in system-space memory, regardless of what the IRQL is.
