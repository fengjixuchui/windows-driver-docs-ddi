# ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite function


## -description


The <b>ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite</b> routine releases the input resource of the indicated thread.


## -parameters




### -param param [in, out]

A pointer to the resource to release.


### -param ResourceThreadId [in]

Identifies the thread that originally acquired the resource. If this is not the currently executing thread, the caller must have transferred ownership of the resource by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exsetresourceownerpointerex">ExSetResourceOwnerPointerEx</a> routine first on the thread that originally acquired the resource.


## -remarks



If this is not the currently executing thread, the caller must have transferred ownership of the resource by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exsetresourceownerpointerex">ExSetResourceOwnerPointerEx</a> routine first on the thread that originally acquired the resource. This is to ensure that thread A does not get terminated or deleted before thread B has a chance to release the resource.

Unless the caller is running in a system thread, the caller must explicitly disable the delivery of normal kernel APCs before calling this routine. This requirement prevents threads from being suspended while they manipulate or hold a resource. The caller can disable normal kernel APC delivery by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-keentercriticalregion">KeEnterCriticalRegion</a> routine. Delivery must remain disabled until the resource is released, at which point it can be reenabled by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-keleavecriticalregion">KeLeaveCriticalRegion</a> routine. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/disabling-apcs">Disabling APCs</a>.

This requirement does not apply to calls made to <b>ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite</b> from a system thread. A caller running in a system thread does not need to explicitly disable APCs before calling this routine.
