# MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress function


## -description


The <b>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress</b> routine checks whether the kernel-mode  driver that is identified by the specified image address is being verified or calls a driver that is being verified by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/what-s-new-in-driver-development">Driver Verifier</a>.


## -parameters




### -param AddressWithinSection [in]

A pointer to the virtual address within the driver image. <b>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress</b> uses this address to determine which driver to check.


## -returns



<b>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the specified driver either is in the driver verification list or imports calls to entry points in a driver that is in the driver verification list. Otherwise, this routine returns <b>FALSE</b>.




## -remarks



A kernel-mode driver can call this routine to determine whether it or another driver is being monitored by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/what-s-new-in-driver-development">Driver Verifier</a>. Driver Verifier monitors kernel-mode drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that might corrupt the system. To select drivers to be verified, you can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/verifier-command-line">Verifier Command Line</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/driver-verifier-manager--windows-xp-and-later-">Driver Verifier Manager</a>. For more information about adding drivers to the driver verification list, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/selecting-drivers-to-be-verified">Selecting Drivers to be Verified</a>.

A similar routine, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-mmisdriververifying">MmIsDriverVerifying</a>, indicates whether a driver identified by a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-driver-objects">driver object</a> is being verified or calls a driver that is being verified.

Another related routine, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-mmisdriversuspectforverifier">MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier</a>, indicates whether a driver represented by a driver object is in the list of drivers that are selected to be verified.

For example, if driver A has an import table through which it calls one or more entry points in driver B, and driver B is in the driver verification list, then <code>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress(Aobj)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b> and <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(Badr)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b>, where <code>Aobj</code> is a pointer to the driver object for A and <code>Badr</code> is an address in driver B. If driver A is not in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(Aobj)</code> returns <b>FALSE</b>. Even if driver B does not call entry points in any drivers that are in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress(Badr)</code> returns <b>TRUE</b> because driver B is in the driver verification list. If a driver C is not in the driver verification list and does not call entry points in any drivers that are in the driver verification list, <code>MmIsDriverVerifyingByAddress(Cadr)</code> and <code>MmIsDriverSuspectForVerifier(Cobj)</code> both return <b>FALSE</b>.
