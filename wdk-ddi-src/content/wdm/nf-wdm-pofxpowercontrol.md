# PoFxPowerControl function


## -description

The <b>PoFxPowerControl</b> routine sends a power control request to the power management framework (PoFx).

## -parameters

### -param Handle 

[in]
A handle that represents the registration of the device with PoFx. The device driver previously received this handle from the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-pofxregisterdevice">PoFxRegisterDevice</a> routine.

### -param PowerControlCode 

[in]
A pointer to the power control code. This code is a GUID value that specifies the requested operation.

### -param InBuffer 

[in, optional]
A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that contains the input data for the operation. The format for the data in this buffer depends on the power control code specified by the <i>PowerControlCode</i> parameter. The <i>InBuffer</i> parameter is optional and can be specified as NULL if the specified operation requires no input data.

### -param InBufferSize 

[in]
The size, in bytes, of the input buffer that is pointed to by the <i>InBuffer</i> parameter. If <i>InBuffer</i> is NULL, set <i>InBufferSize</i> to zero.

### -param OutBuffer 

[out, optional]
A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that is to contain the output data from the operation. The format for the data in this buffer depends on the power control code specified by the <i>PowerControlCode</i> parameter. The <i>OutBuffer</i> parameter is optional and can be specified as NULL if the specified operation produces no output data.

### -param OutBufferSize 

[in]
The size, in bytes, of the output buffer that is pointed to by the <i>OutBuffer</i> parameter. If <i>OutBuffer</i> is NULL, set <i>OutBufferSize</i> to zero.

### -param BytesReturned 

[out, optional]
A pointer to a location into which the routine writes the number of bytes of data that were written to the buffer that is pointed to by <i>OutBuffer</i>. The number of bytes written will be less than or equal to <i>OutBufferSize</i>. This parameter is optional and can be specified as <b>NULL</b> if the caller does not need to know how many bytes were written to the output buffer.

## -returns

<b>PoFxPowerControl</b> returns <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b> if the requested operation succeeds. Possible error return values include the following status code.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

</td>

## -remarks

A device driver calls this routine to send a power control request directly to PoFx. A power control request is similar to an I/O control request (IOCTL). Unlike an IOCTL, however, a power control request is sent directly to PoFx and is not observed by other device drivers in the device stack. During a <b>PoFxPowerControl</b> call, PoFx synchronously performs the requested operation.

Similarly, PoFx can send a power control request directly to the device driver. The driver handles this request in its <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-po_fx_power_control_callback">PowerControlCallback</a> routine.

PoFx delegates the handling of all power control requests to the power engine plug-in (PEP). The PEP is an optional software component that performs power management tasks that are specific to a particular product line of processor or System on a Chip (SoC) modules. If the hardware vendor for the processor or SoC supplies a PEP for a hardware platform, this PEP might handle custom power control requests from a device driver, or might send custom power control requests to the driver's <i>PowerControlCallback</i> routine. The vendor can specify a set of <i>PowerControlCode</i> GUIDs and define the operations that are designated by these GUIDs. As an option, a device driver can contain platform-specific code to handle or to send requests for these operations.
