# KeFlushIoBuffers function


## -description


The <b>KeFlushIoBuffers</b> routine flushes the memory region described by an MDL from caches of all processors.


## -parameters




### -param Mdl [in]

A pointer to an MDL that describes the range for the I/O buffer.


### -param ReadOperation [in]

Specifies <b>TRUE</b> if the flush is being performed for a read operation, and <b>FALSE</b> for a write operation. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


### -param DmaOperation [in]

Specifies <b>TRUE</b> for a DMA transfer, <b>FALSE</b> for PIO.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



Drivers call <b>KeFlushIoBuffers</b> to maintain data integrity during DMA or PIO device transfer operations. Calling this routine affects all processors in the machine.

If <i>ReadOperation</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, the driver is reading information from the device to system memory, so valid data still might be in the processor instruction and data caches. <b>KeFlushIoBuffers</b> flushes data from all processors' caches to system memory, including the processor on which the caller is running.

If <i>ReadOperation</i> is <b>FALSE</b>, the driver is writing data from system memory to a device, so valid data might be in the processor's data cache but not yet transferred to the device. <b>KeFlushIoBuffers</b> flushes all processors' data caches, including that of the processor on which the caller is running.

As a general rule, drivers should call <b>KeFlushIoBuffers</b> just before beginning a DMA transfer operation or immediately following any PIO read operation.

<b>KeFlushIoBuffers</b> flushes only the memory region that is described by the MDL that the <i>Mdl</i> parameter points to. To flush all the memory regions that are described by an MDL chain requires a separate <b>KeFlushIoBuffers</b> call for each MDL in the chain.
