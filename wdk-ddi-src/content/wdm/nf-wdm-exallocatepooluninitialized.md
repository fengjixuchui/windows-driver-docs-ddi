## -description

This routine is a wrapper and replacement option for [**ExAllocatePoolWithTag**](nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag.md).

* To support Windows versions earlier than Windows 10, version 2004, use [**ExAllocatePoolUninitialized**](nf-wdm-exallocatepooluninitialized.md) or [**ExAllocatePoolZero**](nf-wdm-exallocatepoolzero.md).
* To support Windows 10, version 2004 and later, use [**ExAllocatePool2**](nf-wdm-exallocatepool2.md).

## -parameters

### -param PoolType

### -param NumberOfBytes

### -param Tag

## -returns

## -remarks

Use this wrapper if you want to explicitly not zero the allocated memory range.

A driver should only access memory within the byte range that it allocates.  Accessing memory outside this range may corrupt the pool and cause the system to crash. 

> [!NOTE]
> Memory that **ExAllocatePoolUninitialized** allocates is uninitialized. A kernel-mode driver must first zero this memory if it is going to make it visible to user-mode software (to avoid leaking potentially privileged contents). 

See the Remarks section of [**ExAllocatePoolWithTag**](nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag.md) for additional guidance.
