<td>Save in standard format. The standard format is the only format supported by Windows 2000.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Save with no compression, for faster save operations. The registry key object must represent the root of a hive.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field CallContext

### -field ObjectContext

A pointer to driver-defined context information, which the driver has associated with a registry object by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-cmsetcallbackobjectcontext">CmSetCallbackObjectContext</a>. This member is defined starting with Windows Vista.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved for future use. This member is defined starting with Windows Vista.
