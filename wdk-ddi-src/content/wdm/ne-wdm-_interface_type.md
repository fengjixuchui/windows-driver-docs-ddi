# _INTERFACE_TYPE enumeration (wdm.h)


## -description

The <b>INTERFACE_TYPE</b> enumeration indicates the bus type.

## -enum-fields

### -field InterfaceTypeUndefined

Indicates that the interface type is undefined.

### -field Internal

For internal use only.

### -field Isa

Indicates that the interface is published by the ISA bus driver.

### -field Eisa

Indicates that the interface is published by the EISA bus driver.

### -field MicroChannel

Indicates that the interface is published by the MicroChannel bus driver.

### -field TurboChannel

Indicates that the interface is published by the TurboChannel bus driver.

### -field PCIBus

Indicates that the interface is published by the PCI bus driver.

### -field VMEBus

Indicates that the interface is published by the VME bus driver.

### -field NuBus

Indicates that the interface is published by the NuBus driver.

### -field PCMCIABus

Indicates that the interface is published by the PCMCIA bus driver.

### -field CBus

Indicates that the interface is published by the Cbus driver.

### -field MPIBus

Indicates that the interface is published by the MPI bus driver.

### -field MPSABus

Indicates that the interface is published by the MPSA bus driver.

### -field ProcessorInternal

Indicates that the interface is published by the ISA bus driver.

### -field InternalPowerBus

Indicates that the interface is published for an internal power bus. Some devices have power control ports that allow them to share power control with other devices. The Windows architecture represents these devices as slots on a virtual bus called an "internal power bus."

### -field PNPISABus

Indicates that the interface is published by the PNPISA bus driver.

### -field PNPBus

Indicates that the interface is published by the PNP bus driver.

### -field Vmcs

Reserved for use by the operating system.

### -field ACPIBus

Indicates that the interface is published by the ACPI bus driver. The ACPI bus driver enumerates devices that are described in the ACPI firmware of the hardware platform. These devices might physically reside on buses that are controlled by other bus drivers, but the ACPI bus driver must enumerate these devices because the other bus drivers cannot detect them. This interface type is defined starting with WindowsÂ 8.

### -field MaximumInterfaceType

Marks the upper limit of the possible bus types.
