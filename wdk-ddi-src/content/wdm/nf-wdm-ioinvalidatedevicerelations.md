# IoInvalidateDeviceRelations function


## -description


The <b>IoInvalidateDeviceRelations</b> routine notifies the PnP manager that the relations for a device (such as bus relations, ejection relations, removal relations, and the target device relation) have changed.


## -parameters




### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the PDO for the device.


### -param Type [in]

Specifies a <b>DEVICE_RELATION_TYPE</b> enumeration value that describes the type of relations that have changed. Possible values include <b>BusRelations</b>, <b>EjectionRelations</b>, <b>RemovalRelations</b>, and <b>TargetDeviceRelation</b>. Starting with Windows 7, the <b>PowerRelations</b> value is also supported.


## -remarks



For some relation types, such as <b>BusRelations</b>, this routine causes the PnP manager or power manager to gather updated relations information by sending an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-query-device-relations">IRP_MN_QUERY_DEVICE_RELATIONS</a> request to the drivers for the device. For other relation types, such as <b>EjectionRelations</b>, the PnP manager does not need to gather new relation information immediately; the PnP manager queries drivers for ejection relations only when it is preparing to eject a device.

After a bus driver calls <b>IoInvalidateDeviceRelations</b> to inform the PnP manager that a device has disappeared, the bus driver must continue to handle PnP IRPs for that device until it receives an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-remove-device">IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request. In response to this IRP, the bus driver returns STATUS_NO_SUCH_DEVICE. Until the bus driver successfully completes the <b>IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</b> request, the bus driver can access the device extension to check its flags for the device.
