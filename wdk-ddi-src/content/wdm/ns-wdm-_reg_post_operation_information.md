# _REG_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION structure


## -description

The <b>REG_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION</b> structure contains information about a completed registry operation that a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-ex_callback_function">RegistryCallback</a> routine can use.

## -struct-fields

### -field Object

A pointer to the registry key object for which the operation has completed. This member is valid only if the Status member of the structure is set to STATUS_SUCCESS. For more information, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/invalid-key-object-pointers-in-registry-notifications">Invalid Key Object Pointers in Registry Notifications</a>.

### -field Status

The NTSTATUS-typed value that the system will return for the registry operation.

### -field PreInformation

A pointer to the structure that contains preprocessing information for the registry operation that has completed. For example, if the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-ex_callback_function">RegistryCallback</a> routine is processing a <b>RegNtPostQueryValueKey</b> operation, the <b>PreInformation</b> member points to a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_reg_query_value_key_information">REG_QUERY_VALUE_KEY_INFORMATION</a> structure. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

### -field ReturnStatus

A driver-supplied NTSTATUS-typed value. If the driver's <i>RegistryCallback</i> routine returns STATUS_CALLBACK_BYPASS, the operating system uses the <b>ReturnStatus</b> member's value as the status that it returns to the thread that initiated the registry operation. (In such cases, the operating system also copies the <b>ReturnStatus</b> member's value to the <b>Status</b> member.) Otherwise, this member is ignored. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

### -field CallContext

Optional driver-defined context information that the driver's <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-ex_callback_function">RegistryCallback</a> routine can supply. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

### -field ObjectContext

A pointer to driver-defined context information that the driver has associated with a registry object by calling <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-cmsetcallbackobjectcontext">CmSetCallbackObjectContext</a>. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved for future use. This member is defined for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system.
