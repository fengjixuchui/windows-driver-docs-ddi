# ExQueryTimerResolution function


## -description


The <b>ExQueryTimerResolution</b> routine reports the range of timer resolutions that are supported by the system clock.


## -parameters




### -param MaximumTime [out]

A pointer to a location to which the routine writes the maximum time interval, in 100-nanosecond units, between successive ticks of the system clock. A <i>tick</i> is an interrupt caused by the system clock timer.


### -param MinimumTime [out]

A pointer to a location to which the routine writes the minimum time interval, in 100-nanosecond units, between successive ticks of the system clock.


### -param CurrentTime [out]

A pointer to a location to which the routine writes the current time interval, in 100-nanosecond units, between successive ticks of the system clock.


## -remarks



If your driver calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exsettimerresolution">ExSetTimerResolution</a> routine to change the time interval between successive system clock interrupts, the driver can first call <b>ExQueryTimerResolution</b> to determine the range of intervals supported by the system clock.

When your driver calls a routine such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kesettimerex">KeSetTimerEx</a> to set a timer, the accuracy of the timer depends on the resolution of the system clock. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/timer-accuracy">Timer Accuracy</a>.
