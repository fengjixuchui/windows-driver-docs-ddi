# MmAllocatePagesForMdl function


## -description


The <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> routine allocates zero-filled, nonpaged, physical memory pages to an MDL.


## -parameters




### -param LowAddress [in]

Specifies the physical address of the start of the first address range from which the allocated pages can come. If <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> cannot allocate the requested number of bytes in the first address range, it iterates through additional address ranges to get more pages. At each iteration, <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> adds the value of <i>SkipBytes</i> to the previous start address to obtain the start of the next address range.


### -param HighAddress [in]

Specifies the physical address of the end of the first address range from which the allocated pages can come. 


### -param SkipBytes [in]

Specifies the number of bytes to skip from the start of the previous address range from which the allocated pages can come. <i>SkipBytes</i> must be an integer multiple of the virtual memory page size, in bytes. 


### -param TotalBytes [in]

Specifies the total number of bytes to allocate for the MDL. 


## -returns



<b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> returns one of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>MDL pointer</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The MDL pointer describes a set of physical pages in the specified address range. If the requested number of bytes is not available, the MDL describes as much physical memory as is available. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b><b>NULL</b></b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
There are no physical memory pages in the specified address ranges, or there is not enough memory pool for the MDL itself. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



Drivers that are running in Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later versions of Windows should use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-mmallocatepagesformdlex">MmAllocatePagesForMdlEx</a> routine instead of <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b>. <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdlEx</b> provides better performance than <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> by avoiding unnecessary flushes of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/">TLB</a> and cache memory.

The physical memory pages that are returned by <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> are typically not contiguous pages. <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> always fills the allocated pages in the returned MDL with zeros.

<b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> is designed to be used by kernel-mode drivers that do not need corresponding virtual addresses (that is, they need physical pages and do not need the pages to be physically contiguous) or by kernel-mode drivers that can achieve substantial performance gains if physical memory for a device is allocated in a specific physical address range. A driver for an AGP graphics card is an example of such a driver.

Depending on how much physical memory is currently available in the requested ranges, <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> might return an MDL that describes less memory than was requested. The routine returns <b>NULL</b> if no memory was allocated. The caller should check the amount of memory that is actually allocated to the MDL. 

The caller must use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-mmfreepagesfrommdl">MmFreePagesFromMdl</a> to release the memory pages that are described by an MDL that was created by <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b>. After calling <b>MmFreePagesFromMdl</b>, the caller must also call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-exfreepool">ExFreePool</a> to release the memory that is allocated for the MDL structure itself.

In Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows, the maximum amount of memory that <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> can allocate in a single call is (4 gigabytes - PAGE_SIZE). The routine can satisfy an allocation request for this amount only if enough pages are available.

<b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> runs at IRQL <= APC_LEVEL. Windows Server 2008 and later versions of the Windows operating system enable <b>MmAllocatePagesForMdl</b> callers to call at DISPATCH_LEVEL. However, you can improve driver performance by calling at APC_LEVEL or below.
