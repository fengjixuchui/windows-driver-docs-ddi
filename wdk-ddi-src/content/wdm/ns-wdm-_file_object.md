# _FILE_OBJECT structure


## -description

The <b>FILE_OBJECT</b> structure is used by the system to represent a file object. To user-mode protected subsystems, a file object represents an open instance of a file, device, directory, or volume. To device and intermediate drivers, a file object usually represents a device object. To drivers in the file system stack, a file object usually represents a directory or file.

A file object is partially opaque. Certain types of drivers, such as file system drivers and network transport drivers, use some of the fields of file objects.

## -struct-fields

### -field Type

A read-only member used by the system to indicate that the object is a file object. If the object is a file object, the value of this member is 5.

### -field Size

A read-only member that specifies the size, in bytes, of the file object. This size does not include the file object extension, if one is present.

### -field DeviceObject

A pointer to the device object on which the file is opened.

### -field Vpb

A pointer to the volume parameter block associated with the file object.

Note that if the <b>Vpb</b> member is non-<b>NULL</b>, the file resides on a mounted volume.

### -field FsContext

A pointer to whatever optional state a driver maintains about the file object; otherwise, 
      <b>NULL</b>. For file system drivers, this member <u>must</u> point to a 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/ns-ntifs-_fsrtl_advanced_fcb_header">FSRTL_ADVANCED_FCB_HEADER</a> header structure that is contained within a file-system-specific structure; otherwise system instability can result. Usually, this header structure is embedded in a file control block (FCB). However, on some file systems that support multiple data streams, such as NTFS, this header structure is a stream control block (SCB).
      

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  In a WDM device stack, only the functional device object (FDO) can use the two context pointers. File system drivers share this member across multiple opens to the same data stream.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field FsContext2

A pointer to whatever additional state a driver maintains about the file object; otherwise, 
      <b>NULL</b>.
      

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  This member is opaque for drivers in the file system stack because the underlying file system utilizes this member.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field SectionObjectPointer

A pointer to the file object's read-only section object. This member is set only by file systems and used for Cache Manager interaction.

### -field PrivateCacheMap

An opaque member, set only by file systems, that points to handle-specific information and that is used for Cache Manager interaction.

### -field FinalStatus

A read-only member that is used, in certain synchronous cases, to indicate the final status of the file object's I/O request.

### -field RelatedFileObject

A pointer to a <b>FILE_OBJECT</b> structure used to indicate that the current file object has been opened relative to an already open file object. The file object pointed to by this member is usually a directory (meaning the current file has been opened relative to this directory). However, a file can be reopened relative to itself, and alternate data streams for a file can be opened relative to an already open primary data stream for that same file. The <b>RelatedFileObject</b> member is only valid during the processing of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/irp-mj-create">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a> requests.

### -field LockOperation

A read-only member. If <b>FALSE</b>, a lock operation 
      (<b>NtLockFile</b>) has never been performed on the file object. If 
      <b>TRUE</b>, at least one lock operation has been performed on the file object. Once set to 
      <b>TRUE</b>, this member always remains <b>TRUE</b> (for example, releasing file locks on the file object does not reset this member to <b>FALSE</b>).

### -field DeletePending

A read-only member. If <b>TRUE</b>, a delete operation for the file associated with the file object exists. If <b>FALSE</b>, there currently is no pending delete operation for the file object.

### -field ReadAccess

A read-only member. If <b>TRUE</b>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for read access. If <b>FALSE</b>, the file has been opened without read access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.

### -field WriteAccess

A read-only member. If <b>TRUE</b>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for write access. If <b>FALSE</b>, the file has been opened without write access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.

### -field DeleteAccess

A read-only member. If <b>TRUE</b>, the file associated with the file object has been 
      opened for delete access. If <b>FALSE</b>, the file has been opened without delete access. 
      This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.

### -field SharedRead

A read-only member. If <b>TRUE</b>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for read sharing access. If <b>FALSE</b>, the file has been opened without read sharing access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.

### -field SharedWrite

A read-only member. If <b>TRUE</b>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for write sharing access. If <b>FALSE</b>, the file has been opened without write sharing access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.

### -field SharedDelete

A read-only member. If <b>TRUE</b>, the file associated with the file object has been opened for delete sharing access. If <b>FALSE</b>, the file has been opened without delete sharing access. This information is used when checking and/or setting the share access of the file.

### -field Flags

A read-only member used by the system to hold one or more (a bitwise inclusive OR combination) of the following private flag values.

### -field FileName

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/ntdef/ns-ntdef-_unicode_string">UNICODE_STRING</a> structure whose <b>Buffer</b> member points to a read-only Unicode string that holds the name of the file opened on the volume. If the volume is being opened, the <b>Length</b> member of the 
      <b>UNICODE_STRING</b> structure will be zero. Note that the file name in this string is valid only during the initial processing of an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/irp-mj-create">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a> request. This file name should <u>not</u> be considered valid after the file system starts to process the <b>IRP_MJ_CREATE</b> request. The storage for the string pointed to by the <b>Buffer</b> member of the <b>UNICODE_STRING</b> structure is allocated in paged system memory. For more information about obtaining a file name, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltgetfilenameinformation">FltGetFileNameInformation</a>.

### -field CurrentByteOffset

A read-only member that specifies the file offset, in bytes, associated with the file object.

### -field Waiters

A read-only member used by the system to count the number of outstanding waiters on a file object opened for synchronous access.

### -field Busy

A read-only member used by the system to indicate whether a file object opened for synchronous access is currently busy.

### -field LastLock

An opaque pointer to the last lock applied to the file object.

### -field Lock

An opaque member used by the system to hold a file object event lock. The event lock is used to control synchronous access to the file object. Applicable only to file objects that are opened for synchronous access.

### -field Event

An opaque member used by the system to hold an event object for the file object. The event object is used to signal the completion of an I/O request on the file object if no user event was supplied or a synchronous API was called.

### -field CompletionContext

An opaque pointer to completion port information (port pointer and key) associated with the file object, if any.

### -field IrpListLock

An opaque pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks">KSPIN_LOCK</a> structure that serves as the spin lock used to synchronize access to the file object's IRP list.

### -field IrpList

An opaque pointer to the head of the IRP list associated with the file object.

### -field FileObjectExtension

An opaque pointer to the file object's file object extension (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/the-fobx-structure">FOBX</a>) structure. The <b>FOBX</b> structure contains various opaque contexts used internally as well as the per-file object contexts available through <b>FsRtl<i>Xxx</i></b> routines.

## -remarks

Drivers can use the <b>FsContext</b> and <b>FsContext2</b> members to maintain driver-determined state about an open file object. A driver cannot use these members unless the file object is accessible in the driver's I/O stack location of an IRP.

All remaining members in a file object are either opaque or read-only:

<ul>
<li>
Opaque members within a file object should be considered inaccessible. Drivers with dependencies on object field locations or access to opaque members might not remain portable and interoperable with other drivers over time.

</li>
<li>
Drivers can use read-only members to acquire relevant information but must not modify read-only members and, if a pointer, the object that the member points to.

</li>
</ul>
During the processing of an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/irp-mj-create">IRP_MJ_CREATE</a> request, a file system driver calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iosetshareaccess">IoSetShareAccess</a> routine (if the client is the first to open the file) or the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocheckshareaccess">IoCheckShareAccess</a> routine (for subsequent clients that want to share the file). <b>IoSetShareAccess</b> and <b>IoCheckShareAccess</b> update the <b>ReadAccess</b>, <b>WriteAccess</b>, and <b>DeleteAccess</b> members to indicate the access rights that are granted to the client if the client has exclusive access to the file. Additionally, <b>IoCheckShareAccess</b> updates the <b>SharedRead</b>, <b>SharedWrite</b>, and <b>SharedDelete</b> members to indicate the access rights that are simultaneously granted to two or more clients that share the file. If the driver for a device other than a file system has to monitor the access rights of clients, this driver typically stores access rights information in context buffers that are pointed to by the <b>FsContext</b> and <b>FsContext2</b> members.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The type of object (for example, a file, directory, or volume) that a given file object represents cannot be determined by only examining the contents of the file object structure. For information about how to determine the type of object that a file object represents, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntqueryinformationfile">ZwQueryInformationFile</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
The Common Log File System (CLFS) uses the <b>LOG_FILE_OBJECT</b> structure to represent logs. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-clfscreatelogfile">ClfsCreateLogFile</a> function returns a pointer to a <b>LOG_FILE_OBJECT</b> structure, which clients then pass to other CLFS functions. 

CLFS clients do not directly access the members of a <b>LOG_FILE_OBJECT</b> structure.
