# IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait macro


## -description


The <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> routine releases a remove lock that the driver acquired in a previous call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioacquireremovelock">IoAcquireRemoveLock</a>, and waits until all acquisitions of the lock have been released.


## -parameters




### -param RemoveLock [in]

Pointer to an <b>IO_REMOVE_LOCK</b> structure that the caller passed in a previous call to <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b>. 


### -param Tag [in]

Pointer to a caller-supplied tag that was passed in a previous call to <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b>. 

If a driver specified a <i>Tag</i> when it acquired the lock, the driver must specify the same <i>Tag</i> when releasing the lock. 

If the call to <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b> did not specify a <i>Tag</i>, then this parameter is <b>NULL</b>.



## -remarks



A driver typically calls this routine in its dispatch code for an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-remove-device">IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</a> request. To allow queued I/O requests to complete, each driver should call <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> <i>after</i> it passes the remove IRP to the next-lower driver, and <i>before</i> it releases memory, calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iodetachdevice">IoDetachDevice</a>, or calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iodeletedevice">IoDeleteDevice</a>. The <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> routine waits for the bus driver to cancel any IRPs that might be outstanding (for example, an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-wait-wake">IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE</a> IRP).

A driver must acquire the remove lock before calling <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b>. Typically, a driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioacquireremovelock">IoAcquireRemoveLock</a> early in its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch">DispatchPnp</a> routine, before the switch statement. As a result, the lock is acquired for each PnP operation, including the acquisition that is required before calling <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> in the code that handles <b>IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</b>.

To release a lock from code other than the <b>IRP_MN_REMOVE_DEVICE</b> dispatch code, use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioreleaseremovelock">IoReleaseRemoveLock</a>.

After <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> has been called for a particular remove lock, subsequent calls to <b>IoAcquireRemoveLock</b> for the same remove lock will fail. <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> does not return until all outstanding acquisitions of the remove lock have been released.

After <b>IoReleaseRemoveLockAndWait</b> returns, the driver should consider the device to be in a state in which it is ready to be removed and cannot perform I/O operations. Therefore, the driver must not call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioinitializeremovelock">IoInitializeRemoveLock</a> routine to re-initialize the remove lock. Violation of this rule while the driver is being verified by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/what-s-new-in-driver-development">Driver Verifier</a> will result in a bug check.

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-remove-locks">Using Remove Locks</a>.
