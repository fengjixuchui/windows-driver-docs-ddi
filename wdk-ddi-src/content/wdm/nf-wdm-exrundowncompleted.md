# ExRundownCompleted function


## -description


The <b>ExRundownCompleted</b> routine updates the run-down status of a shared object to indicate that the run down of the object has completed.


## -parameters




### -param RunRef [out]

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/eprocess">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure that was initialized by a previous call to the  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exinitializerundownprotection">ExInitializeRundownProtection</a> routine. The run-down protection routines use this structure to track the run-down status of the associated shared object. This structure is opaque to drivers.


## -remarks



This routine is called by the driver that owns an object that resides in shared memory and that is accessed by other drivers. The <b>ExRundownCompleted</b> call must be preceded by a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exwaitforrundownprotectionrelease">ExWaitForRundownProtectionRelease</a> routine that runs down the object.

After an <b>ExRundownCompleted</b> call, additional calls to <b>ExWaitForRundownProtectionRelease</b> to run down the associated object return immediately without waiting. However, calls to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exacquirerundownprotection">ExAcquireRundownProtection</a> to acquire run-down protection on the associated object fail (return <b>FALSE</b>).

After an <b>ExRundownCompleted</b> call, the driver can call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exreinitializerundownprotection">ExReInitializeRundownProtection</a> routine to associate the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/eprocess">EX_RUNDOWN_REF</a> structure with a new object and to initialize run-down protection on this object. After the <b>ExReInitializeRundownProtection</b> call, drivers can call <b>ExAcquireRundownProtection</b> to acquire run-down protection on the new object.

On entry, the status information in the <b>EX_RUNDOWN_REF</b> structure must indicate that the object that was associated with this structure was run down. 

For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/run-down-protection">Run-Down Protection</a>.
