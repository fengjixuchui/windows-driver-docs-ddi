# RtlCompareMemory function


## -description


The <b>RtlCompareMemory</b> routine compares two blocks of memory and returns the number of bytes that match.


## -parameters




### -param Source1 [in]

A pointer to the first block of memory.


### -param Source2 [in]

A pointer to the second block of memory.


### -param Length [in]

The number of bytes to compare.


## -returns



<b>RtlCompareMemory</b> returns the number of bytes in the two blocks that match. If all bytes match up to the specified <i>Length</i> value, the <i>Length</i> value is returned.




## -remarks



The routine starts by comparing the first byte in the first block to the first byte in the second block, and continues to compare successive bytes in the two blocks while the bytes match. The routine stops comparing bytes when it encounters the first pair of bytes that are not equal, or when the number of matching bytes equals the <i>Length</i> parameter value, whichever occurs first.

Callers of <b>RtlCompareMemory</b> can be running at any IRQL if both blocks of memory are resident.
