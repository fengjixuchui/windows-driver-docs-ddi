# _OB_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION structure


## -description


The <b>OB_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION</b> structure provides information about a process or thread handle operation to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nc-wdm-pob_post_operation_callback">ObjectPostCallback</a> routine.


## -struct-fields




### -field Operation

The type of handle operation. This member might be one of the following values:





#### OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_CREATE

A new handle to a process or thread was created. Use <b>Parameters->CreateHandleInformation</b> for create-specific information.



#### OB_OPERATION_HANDLE_DUPLICATE

A process or thread handle was duplicated. Use <b>Parameters->DuplicateHandleInformation</b> for duplicate-specific information.


### -field Flags

Reserved. Use the <b>KernelHandle</b> member instead. 


### -field KernelHandle

A ULONG value that specifies whether the handle is a kernel handle. If this value is <b>TRUE</b>, the handle is a kernel handle. Otherwise, the handle is not a kernel handle.


### -field Reserved

Reserved for system use.


### -field Object

A pointer to the process or thread object that is the target of the handle operation.


### -field ObjectType

A pointer to the object type of the object. This type can be <b>PsProcessType</b> for a process or <b>PsThreadType</b> for a thread. 


### -field CallContext

A pointer to driver-specific context information for the operation. This value is the value that the <i>OperationInformation</i>-><b>CallContext</b> member specifies to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nc-wdm-pob_pre_operation_callback">ObjectPreCallback</a> routine. 


### -field ReturnStatus

The NTSTATUS value for the handle operation.


### -field Parameters

A pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_ob_post_operation_parameters">OB_POST_OPERATION_PARAMETERS</a> union that contains operation-specific information. The <b>Operation</b> member determines which member of the union is valid. The pointer is valid only when <b>ReturnStatus</b> is a success code.


## -remarks



Unlike the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_ob_pre_operation_information">OB_PRE_OPERATION_INFORMATION</a> structure, the members of the <b>OB_POST_OPERATION_INFORMATION</b> structure are purely informational; you cannot modify them.
