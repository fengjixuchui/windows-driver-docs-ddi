# _FAST_IO_DISPATCH structure


## -description


Contains a set of callback routines that a file system driver or file system filter driver (legacy) provides for fast I/O processing.


## -struct-fields




### -field SizeOfFastIoDispatch

Set to <b>sizeof</b>(FAST_IO_DISPATCH).


### -field FastIoCheckIfPossible

A pointer to a callback routine that checks if fast I/O is possible for a either a read or a write operation.


### -field FastIoRead

A pointer to a callback routine that does a fast cached read, bypassing the IRP read path.  It is used to perform a copy read
    for a cached file object.


### -field FastIoWrite

A pointer to a callback routine that does a fast cached write, bypassing the IRP write path.  It is used to perform a copy write
    for a cached file object.


### -field FastIoQueryBasicInfo

A pointer to a callback routine for fast query of basic file information.


### -field FastIoQueryStandardInfo

A pointer to a callback routine for fast query of standard file information.


### -field FastIoLock

A pointer to a callback routine for doing a fast lock on a file object.


### -field FastIoUnlockSingle

A pointer to a callback routine for doing a fast release of a single lock on a file object.


### -field FastIoUnlockAll

A pointer to a callback routine for doing a fast release of a all locks held on a file object.


### -field FastIoUnlockAllByKey

A pointer to a callback routine for doing a fast release of a all locks grouped by a key.


### -field FastIoDeviceControl

A pointer to a callback routine for fast device control processing.


### -field AcquireFileForNtCreateSection

A pointer to a callback routine used by the memory manager to acquire a file exclusively.


### -field ReleaseFileForNtCreateSection

A pointer to a callback routine used by the memory manager to release a previously acquired file.


### -field FastIoDetachDevice

A pointer to a callback routine that is invoked to detach the current device object from a device object that
    is being deleted. 


### -field FastIoQueryNetworkOpenInfo

A pointer to a callback routine for fast query of network file information.


### -field AcquireForModWrite

A pointer to a callback routine that decides which file system resource the modified page
    writer should acquire and acquires it if possible.


### -field MdlRead

A pointer to a callback routine that does a fast cached MDL read, bypassing the IRP read path.  It is used to perform a copy read
    for a cached file object.


### -field MdlReadComplete

A pointer to a callback routine that performs a fast completion of an MDL read.


### -field PrepareMdlWrite

A pointer to a callback routine that does a fast cached MDL write, bypassing the IRP write path.  It is used to perform a copy write
    for a cached file object.


### -field MdlWriteComplete

A pointer to a callback routine that performs a fast completion of an MDL write.


### -field FastIoReadCompressed

A pointer to a callback routine that performs a fast  compressed read of data from a file.


### -field FastIoWriteCompressed

A pointer to a callback routine that performs a fast  compressed write of data to  a file.


### -field MdlReadCompleteCompressed

A pointer to a callback routine that completes  a fast  MDL compressed read of data from  a file.


### -field MdlWriteCompleteCompressed

A pointer to a callback routine that completes  a fast  MDL compressed write of data to  a file.


### -field FastIoQueryOpen

A pointer to a callback routine that implements  a fast  open for path based queries.


### -field ReleaseForModWrite

This routine releases a file system resource previously acquired for
    the modified page write.


### -field AcquireForCcFlush

A pointer to a callback routine that acquires a file system resource prior to a cache flush.


### -field ReleaseForCcFlush

A pointer to a callback routine that releases a file system resource previously acquired for a cache flush.
