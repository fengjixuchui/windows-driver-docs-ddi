# _KINTERRUPT_POLARITY enumeration


## -description


The <b>KINTERRUPT_POLARITY</b> enumeration indicates how a device signals an interrupt request on an interrupt line.


## -enum-fields




### -field InterruptPolarityUnknown

The interrupt polarity is unknown.


### -field InterruptActiveHigh

Active-high interrupt. The interrupt input type is level-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a high signal level on the interrupt line. The request remains active as long as the line remains high.


### -field InterruptRisingEdge

Rising-edge-triggered interrupt. The interrupt input type is edge-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a low-to-high transition on the interrupt line.


### -field InterruptActiveLow

Active-low interrupt. The interrupt input type is level-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a low signal level on the interrupt line. The request remains active as long as the line remains low.


### -field InterruptFallingEdge

Falling-edge-triggered interrupt. The interrupt input type is edge-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a high-to-low transition on the interrupt line.


### -field InterruptActiveBoth

Active-both interrupt. The interrupt input type is edge-triggered, and an interrupt request is indicated by a low-to-high or a high-to-low transition on the interrupt line. After a low-to-high transition signals an interrupt request, the interrupt line remains high until a high-to-low transition signals the next interrupt request. Similarly, after a high-to-low transition signals an interrupt request, the interrupt line remains low until a low-to-high transition signals the next interrupt request.


### -field InterruptActiveBothTriggerLow

Reserved for use by the operating system.


### -field InterruptActiveBothTriggerHigh

Reserved for use by the operating system.


## -remarks



A <b>KINTERRUPT_POLARITY</b> enumeration constant is frequently used in conjunction with a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ne-wdm-_kinterrupt_mode">KINTERRUPT_MODE</a> enumeration constant to describe an interrupt signal. A <b>KINTERRUPT_MODE</b> enumeration constant indicates whether the interrupt signal from a device is level-triggered or edge-triggered.
