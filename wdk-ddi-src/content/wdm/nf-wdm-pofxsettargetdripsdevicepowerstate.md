# PoFxSetTargetDripsDevicePowerState function


## -description

    This routine is called to notify the power manager of the device's target
    device power state for DRIPS.  The driver can override the
    DRIPS constraint provided by the PEP.

## -parameters

### -param Handle 

[in]
A handle that represents the registration of the device with PoFx. The device driver previously received this handle from the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-pofxregisterdevice">PoFxRegisterDevice</a> routine.

### -param TargetState 

[in]
Specifies the target DRIPS device power state. Possible values are defined in the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/ne-wudfddi-_device_power_state">DEVICE_POWER_STATE</a> enumeration. This value must
    be lower than the existing device constraint.  A device power state
    of <b>PowerDeviceUnspecified</b> resets to the PEP provided constraint.

## -returns

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the target state was accepted.
