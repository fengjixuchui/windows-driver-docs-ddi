# IoGetDeviceDirectory function


## -description

Returns a handle to a directory on disk, in which drivers can store files. The files in that directory apply to a specific device instance.

## -parameters

### -param PhysicalDeviceObject

[_In_] A pointer to the [physical device object](ns-wdm-_device_object.md) being queried in the device stack of a particular device instance. Must not be NULL.

### -param DirectoryType

[_In_] A [**_DEVICE_DIRECTORY_TYPE**](ne-wdm-_device_directory_type.md)-type value that indicates the type of requested directory.

### -param Flags

[_In_] Must be 0.

### -param Reserved

[_In_] Reserved. Must be NULL.

### -param DeviceDirectoryHandle

[_Out_] A pointer to a variable that receives a HANDLE to the requested device directory. The caller must not pass NULL.

## -returns

Returns an appropriate [NTSTATUS value](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values). Possible values include:

| Error code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| STATUS_SUCCESS | The call successfully opened a handle to the requested device directory. |
| STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | An input value to this function is invalid. For example, _PhysicalDeviceObject_ or _DeviceDirectoryHandle_ is NULL;  _Flags_ is not 0;  _Reserved_ is not NULL. |

## -remarks

If **IoGetDeviceDirectory** is called before the required disks and volumes have been started, the function does not open a handle and returns an error. 

Drivers typically use [**ZwOpenFile**](nf-wdm-zwopenfile.md) and [**ZwCreateFile**](nf-wdm-zwcreatefile.md) to access/create files. One of the parameters for those functions is an [**OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES**](https:://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_status_block) structure, which contains the object name and a root directory. If the root directory is NULL, then the object name must be a fully qualified path. However, if you provide a handle for the root directory, then the object name must be relative to the object (in the case of files, the directory), that the handle represents. 

After the **IoGetDeviceDirectory** call succeeds, use the received HANDLE as a root directory in the [**OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES**](https:://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_status_block) that you are passing to a [**ZwOpenFile**](nf-wdm-zwopenfile.md) and [**ZwCreateFile**](nf-wdm-zwcreatefile.md).


The driver must call [**ZwClose**](nf-wdm-zwclose.md) to close the received handle when access is no longer required.

Callers of **IoGetDeviceDirectory** must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL in the context of a system thread.
