# PoRegisterSystemState function


## -description


The <b>PoRegisterSystemState</b> routine registers the system as busy due to certain activity.


## -parameters




### -param StateHandle [in, out]

A pointer to a caller-supplied buffer for a registration state handle. The size, in bytes, of the buffer is <b>sizeof</b>(ULONG). If <b>NULL</b>, this is a new registration. If non-<b>NULL</b>, this parameter points to a handle that was returned by a previous call to <b>PoRegisterSystemState</b>.


### -param Flags [in]

Indicates the type of activity, as specified by a bitwise OR of one or more of the following values:





#### ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED

The system is not idle, regardless of apparent load.



#### ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED

Use of the display is required.



#### ES_USER_PRESENT

A user is present.



#### ES_CONTINUOUS

The settings are continuous and should remain in effect until explicitly changed.


##### - Flags.ES_CONTINUOUS

The settings are continuous and should remain in effect until explicitly changed.


##### - Flags.ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED

Use of the display is required.


##### - Flags.ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED

The system is not idle, regardless of apparent load.


##### - Flags.ES_USER_PRESENT

A user is present.


## -returns



<b>PoRegisterSystemState</b> returns a handle to be used later to change or unregister the system busy state. It returns <b>NULL</b> if the handle could not be allocated.




## -remarks



<b>PoRegisterSystemState</b> registers the system busy state as indicated by the flags. The registration persists until the caller explicitly changes it with another call to <b>PoRegisterSystemState</b> or cancels it with a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntifs/nf-ntifs-pounregistersystemstate">PoUnregisterSystemState</a>.

The <i>Flags</i> parameter specifies the type of activity in progress. Drivers can specify any combination of the flags.

Setting ES_CONTINUOUS makes the busy state persist until a driver explicitly changes or cancels it by calling <b>PoRegisterSystemState</b> or <b>PoUnregisterSystemState</b>.

A driver can set the system busy state to request that the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/power-manager">power manager</a> avoid system power state transitions out of the system working state (S0) while driver activity is occurring. Note, however, that under some circumstances (such as a critically low battery) the power manager may override this request and put the system to sleep anyway.

To set the system power state, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-posetsystemstate">PoSetSystemState</a>.
