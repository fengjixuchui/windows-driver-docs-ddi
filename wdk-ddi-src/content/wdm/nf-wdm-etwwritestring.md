# EtwWriteString function


## -description

The <b>EventWriteString</b> function is a tracing function that you can use when no sophisticated data is required. This function is similar to a debug print statement.

## -parameters

### -param RegHandle 

[in]
A Pointer to the event provider registration handle, which is returned by the <b>EtwRegister</b> function if the event provider registration is successful.

### -param Level 

[in]
The level at which the event is active.

### -param Keyword 

[in]
The keyword for the event. A keyword is a bitmask that makes general statements about the category of the event or error. Because the keyword is a bitmask, you can apply more than one keyword to a single event. You can define the keywords and bit positions, or you can use Windows-standard keywords, or you can use combination of your own keywords and the Windows keywords.

### -param ActivityId 

[in, optional]
The identifier that indicates the activity associated with the event. The <i>ActivityId</i> provides a way to group related events and is used in end-to-end tracing. This identifier is optional and can be <b>NULL</b>.

### -param String 

[in]
A null-terminated string (WCHAR).

## -returns

The function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the event is published successfully.

## -remarks

Because the string produced by <b>EventWriteString</b> function is not localizable, this function is not recommended for use in production code. This function should not be used to log highly visible events.

You can call <b>EtwWriteString</b> at any IRQL. However, when IRQL is greater than APC_LEVEL, any data passed to the <b>EtwWrite</b>, <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-etwwriteex">EtwWriteEx</a>, <b>EtwWriteString</b>,  and <b>EtwWriteTransfer</b> functions must not be pageable. That is, any kernel-mode routine that is running at IRQL greater than APC_LEVEL cannot access pageable memory. Data passed to the <b>EtwWrite</b>, <b>EtwWriteEx</b>, <b>EtwWriteString</b>, and <b>EtwWriteTransfer</b> functions must reside in system-space memory, regardless of what the IRQL is.
