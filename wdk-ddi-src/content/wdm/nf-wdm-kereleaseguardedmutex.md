# KeReleaseGuardedMutex function


## -description

The <b>KeReleaseGuardedMutex</b> routine releases a guarded mutex acquired with <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff551892(v=vs.85)">KeAcquireGuardedMutex</a> or <a href="/previous-versions/ff553307(v=vs.85)">KeTryToAcquireGuardedMutex</a>.

## -parameters

### -param Mutex 

[in, out]
Pointer to the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/eprocess">KGUARDED_MUTEX</a> structure for the guarded mutex.

## -remarks

<b>KeReleaseGuardedMutex</b> implicitly exits the guarded region entered by <b>KeAcquireGuardedMutex</b> and <b>KeTryToAcquireGuardedMutex</b>.

For more information about guarded mutexes, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/fast-mutexes-and-guarded-mutexes">Fast Mutexes and Guarded Mutexes</a>.
