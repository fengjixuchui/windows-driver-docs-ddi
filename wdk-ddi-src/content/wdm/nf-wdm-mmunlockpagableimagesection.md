# MmUnlockPagableImageSection function


## -description


The <b>MmUnlockPagableImageSection</b> routine releases a section of driver code or driver data, previously locked into system space with <b>MmLockPagableCodeSection</b>, <b>MmLockPagableDataSection</b> or <b>MmLockPagableSectionByHandle</b>, so the section can be paged out again. 


## -parameters




### -param ImageSectionHandle [in]

Specifies the handle returned by a call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-mmlockpagablecodesection">MmLockPagableCodeSection</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-mmlockpagabledatasection">MmLockPagableDataSection</a>. 


## -returns



None




## -remarks



The handle for a driver's pageable section must not be released if the driver has any outstanding IRPs in its device queue(s) or internal queue(s). A call to <b>MmUnlockPagableImageSection</b> restores the pageability of that entire section when there are no more references to the handle for that section. 

The memory manager maintains the reference count on the handle to a section. A pageable section is only available to be paged out when the reference count is zero. Every lock request increments the count; every unlock request decrements the count. A driver must unlock a section as many times as it locks a section to make the section available to be paged out.

A handle is always valid, no matter what the count. If the count on a handle is zero and a call is made to <b>MmLockPagableSectionByHandle</b>, the count is set to one, and if the section has been paged out, it will be paged in.

In most cases, <b>MmUnlockPagableImageSection</b> is called before a driver's <i>Unload</i> routine. That is, a driver with a pageable section is likely to have its <i>DispatchClose</i> and/or <i>DispatchShutdown</i> routine call <b>MmUnlockPagableImageSection</b> before its <i>Unload</i> routine is called. However, care should be taken in unloadable drivers to release any pageable section before the driver itself is unloaded from the system.
