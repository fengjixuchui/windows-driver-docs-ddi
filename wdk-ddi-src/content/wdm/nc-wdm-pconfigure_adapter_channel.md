# PCONFIGURE_ADAPTER_CHANNEL callback function


## -description


The <b>ConfigureAdapterChannel</b> routine invokes a custom function that is implemented by the DMA controller represented by an adapter object.


## -parameters




### -param DmaAdapter [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_dma_adapter">DMA_ADAPTER</a> structure. This structure is the adapter object that represents the driver's system DMA channel. The caller obtained this pointer from a previous call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> routine.


### -param FunctionNumber [in]

The number of the custom function to select. For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -param Context [in]

A pointer to the configuration parameters for the custom function that is specified by <i>FunctionNumber</i>. The function is implemented by the DMA controller and can be accessed by a device driver through the adapter object. The DMA controller and the device driver must agree on the meaning of these configuration parameters. The data that <i>Context</i> points to is opaque to the operating system.


## -returns



<b>ConfigureAdapterChannel</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Possible error return values include the following status code.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt>STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The  DMA extension does not implement the function specified by <i>FunctionNumber</i>.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



<b>ConfigureAdapterChannel</b><i> is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine can be called only by pointer from the address returned in a </i><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_dma_operations">DMA_OPERATIONS</a><i> structure. </i>Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter">IoGetDmaAdapter</a> with the <b>Version</b> member of the <i>DeviceDescription</i> parameter set to DEVICE_DESCRIPTION_VERSION3. If <b>IoGetDmaAdapter</b> returns <b>NULL</b>, the routine is not available on your platform.

Use <b>ConfigureAdapterChannel</b> only for system DMA adapters. Do not use this routine for a bus-master adapter.

A particular system DMA controller might have special hardware features that device drivers can access through a set of one or more custom functions. A controller might implement more than one custom function, in which case each function is identified by a different function number. These functions abstract the DMA hardware features so that the same functions can be supported on different hardware platforms.

Typically, a custom function sets state information in the DMA controller to configure hardware features for use  in subsequent DMA transfers.
