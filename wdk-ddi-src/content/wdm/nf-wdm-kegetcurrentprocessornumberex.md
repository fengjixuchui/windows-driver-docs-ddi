# KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx function


## -description


The <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx</b> routine gets the processor number of the logical processor that the caller is running on. 


## -parameters




### -param ProcNumber [out, optional]

A pointer to a caller-allocated buffer into which the routine writes a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/miniport/ns-miniport-_processor_number">PROCESSOR_NUMBER</a> structure that identifies the current logical processor. This structure contains the group number and the group-relative processor number. You can set this parameter to <b>NULL</b> if you do not need this information. 


## -returns



<b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx</b> returns the systemwide processor index of the logical processor that the caller is running on. 




## -remarks



If <i>ProcNumber</i> is non-<b>NULL</b>, the buffer that is pointed to by <i>ProcNumber</i> must be large enough to contain a PROCESSOR_NUMBER structure. In contrast to this structure, which contains a group number and a group-relative processor number, the return value is a processor index that identifies the processor across the entire multiprocessor system.

For example, if a multiprocessor system contains two groups, and each group contains 64 logical processors, the processor numbers in each group range from 0 to 63, but the systemwide processor indexes range from 0 to 127.

A related routine, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-kegetcurrentprocessornumber">KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</a>, returns the current processor number, but this routine, unlike <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx</b>, does not provide a group number for the processor. In Windows 7 and later versions of the Windows operating system, <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> returns the group-relative processor number if the caller is running on a processor in group 0, which is compatible with the behavior of this routine in earlier versions of Windows that do not support groups. However, if the caller is running on a processor in any group other than group 0, this routine returns a number that is less than the number of processors in group 0. This behavior ensures that the return value is less than the return value of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kequeryactiveprocessorcount">KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</a> routine. Existing drivers that call <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b> and that use no group-oriented features run correctly in multiprocessor systems that have two or more groups. However, drivers that use any group-oriented features in Windows 7 and later versions of the Windows operating system should call <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx</b> instead of <b>KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber</b>.
