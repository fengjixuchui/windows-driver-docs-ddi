# RtlMoveMemory macro


## -description


The <b>RtlMoveMemory</b> routine copies the contents of a source memory block to a destination memory block, and supports overlapping source and destination memory blocks.


## -parameters




### -param Destination [out]

Datatype: void*. A pointer to the destination memory block to copy the bytes to.


### -param Source [in]

Datatype: const void*. A pointer to the source memory block to copy the bytes from.


### -param Length [in]

Datatype: size_t. The number of bytes to copy from the source to the destination.


## -remarks



The source memory block, which is defined by <i>Source</i> and <i>Length</i>, can overlap the destination memory block, which is defined by <i>Destination</i> and <i>Length</i>.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-rtlcopymemory">RtlCopyMemory</a> routine runs faster than <b>RtlMoveMemory</b>, but <b>RtlCopyMemory</b> requires that the source and destination memory blocks do not overlap.

Callers of <b>RtlMoveMemory</b> can be running at any IRQL if the source and destination memory blocks are in nonpaged system memory. Otherwise, the caller must be running at IRQL <= APC_LEVEL.
