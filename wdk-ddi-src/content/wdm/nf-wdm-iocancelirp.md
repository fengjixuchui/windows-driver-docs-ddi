# IoCancelIrp function


## -description


The <b>IoCancelIrp</b> routine sets the cancel bit in a given IRP and calls the cancel routine for the IRP if there is one.


## -parameters




### -param Irp [in]

A pointer to the IRP to be canceled.


## -returns



<b>IoCancelIrp</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the IRP had a cancel routine and this routine was called. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>. In either case, the IRP's cancel bit is set to <b>TRUE</b>. For more information, see Remarks.




## -remarks



If the IRP has a cancel routine, <b>IoCancelIrp</b> sets the cancel bit and calls the cancel routine.

If <i>Irp</i>-><b>CancelRoutine</b> is <b>NULL</b>, and therefore the IRP is not cancelable, <b>IoCancelIrp</b> sets the IRP's cancel bit and returns <b>FALSE</b>. The IRP should be canceled at a later time when it becomes cancelable.

If a driver that does not own the IRP calls <b>IoCancelIrp</b>, the results are unpredictable. The IRP might be completed with a successful status even though its cancel bit was set.

An intermediate driver should not arbitrarily call <b>IoCancelIrp</b> unless that driver created the IRP passed in the call. Otherwise, the intermediate driver might cancel an IRP that some higher-level driver is tracking for purposes of its own.
