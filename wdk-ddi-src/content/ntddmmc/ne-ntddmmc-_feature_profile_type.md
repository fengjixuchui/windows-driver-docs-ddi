## -enum-fields

### -field ProfileInvalid

Does not indicate a valid profile.

### -field ProfileNonRemovableDisk

Indicates the profile named "Nonremovable disk" by the <i>SCSI-3 Multimedia (MMC-3)</i> specification. This profile is used with devices that manage rewritable media and are capable of changing behavior.

### -field ProfileRemovableDisk

Indicates the profile named "Removable disk" by the <i>MMC-3</i> specification. This profile is used with devices that manage rewritable, removable media.

### -field ProfileMOErasable

Indicates the profile named "MO Erasable" by the <i>MMC-3</i> specification. This profile is used with devices that manage magneto-optical media and that have a sector-erase capability.

### -field ProfileMOWriteOnce

Indicates the profile named "MO Write Once" by the <i>MMC-3</i> specification. This profile is used with devices that manage magneto-optical write-once media.

### -field ProfileAS_MO

Indicates the profile named "AS-MO" by the <i>MMC-3</i> specification. This profile is used with devices that implement Advance Storage technology and manage magneto-optical media.

### -field ProfileCdrom

Indicates the profile named "CD-ROM" by the <i>MMC-3</i> specification. This profile is used with devices that manage read-only compact disc media.

### -field ProfileCdRecordable
