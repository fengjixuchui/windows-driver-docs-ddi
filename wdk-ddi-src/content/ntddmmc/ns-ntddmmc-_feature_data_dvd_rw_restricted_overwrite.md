## -struct-fields




### -field Header

Contains a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddmmc/ns-ntddmmc-_feature_header">FEATURE_HEADER</a> structure with header information for this feature descriptor. 


### -field Blank

Indicates, when set to 1, that the device supports the BLANK command defined by the <i>SCSI Multimedia - 4 (MMC-4)</i> specification, with Blanking Types of zero and one. When set to zero, this bit indicates that the device does not support this command.
