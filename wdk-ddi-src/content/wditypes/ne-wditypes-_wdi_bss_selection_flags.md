# _WDI_BSS_SELECTION_FLAGS enumeration


## -description


The WDI_BSS_SELECTION_FLAGS enumeration defines flags for BSS selection.


## -enum-fields




### -field WDI_BSS_SELECTION_HOST_PREFERRED

Set for BSS entries that the host prefers to connect to. Non-preferred BSS entries would also be provided to the port, but should only be used  for connection if port performs its own BSS ranking.


### -field WDI_BSS_SELECTION_RECENT_ASSOCIATION_ERROR

Set for BSS entries that had recent association failures or were recently disassociated from. This flag is already accounted for by the host when setting WDI_BSS_SELECTION_HOST_PREFERRED.


### -field WDI_BSS_SELECTION_FLAGS_AP_REQUESTED_TRANSITION

Specifies whether this roam was requested by the AP or not (11v BSS Transition management request).
