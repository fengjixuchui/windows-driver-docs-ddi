# WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS enumeration

## -description

The **WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS** defines the response status for a Fine Timing Measurement (FTM) request. 

## -enum-fields

### -field WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS_SUCCESS 

The FTM was a success.

### -field WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS_UNREACHABLE 

No ACK was received for the FTM request from the target, or no first FTM frame was received afterwards. The application will be advised to first trigger a new scan before retrying.

### -field WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS_REJECTED 

The status indication field from Table 9-256 of the [802-11-2016 standard](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_11-2016.html) was set to **3**. A **RetryValue** should be provided and the application will be advised to retry only after that time has passed.

### -field WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS_INCAPABLE 

The status indication field from Table 9-256 of the [802-11-2016 standard](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_11-2016.html) was set to **2**. The application will be advised not to retry.

### -field WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS_TIMEOUT 

The FTM session was started but it did not complete before the timeout expired. A retry to this STA might work.

### -field WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS_NOT_ATTEMPTED 

The FTM session was not initiated. It is highly likely that a retry to this STA will work.

### -field WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS_ABORTED 

The FTM procedure did not complete because the task was aborted. It is likely that a retry to this STA will work.

### -field WDI_FTM_RESPONSE_STATUS_FAILED 

The FTM procedure failed with any other failure besides the preceding failure responses. A retry to this STA might or might not work.

## -remarks

This enumeration is a value in the [WDI_TLV_FTM_RESPONSE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/wdi-tlv-ftm-response) TLV.
