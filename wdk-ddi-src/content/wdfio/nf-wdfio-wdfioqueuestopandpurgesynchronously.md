# WdfIoQueueStopAndPurgeSynchronously function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]</p>


   The <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurgeSynchronously</b> method 
  prevents an I/O queue from delivering new I/O requests and causes the framework to cancel existing unprocessed requests and driver-owned cancellable requests, but the queue receives and stores new requests.


## -parameters




### -param Queue [in]

A handle to a framework queue object.


## -remarks



This method returns after all the unprocessed and driver-owned requests (not including requests added to the queue after this call is made) are completed or canceled. If new requests are inserted while <b>WdfIoQueueStopAndPurgeSynchronously</b> is in progress, these new requests are not delivered until driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfio/nf-wdfio-wdfioqueuestart">WdfIoQueueStart</a>.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.
