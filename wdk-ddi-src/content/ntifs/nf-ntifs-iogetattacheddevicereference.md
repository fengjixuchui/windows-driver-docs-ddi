# IoGetAttachedDeviceReference function


## -description


The <b>IoGetAttachedDeviceReference</b> routine returns a pointer to the highest level device object in a driver stack and increments the reference count on that object.


## -parameters




### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the device object for which the topmost attached device object is retrieved. 


## -returns



<b>IoGetAttachedDeviceReference</b> returns a pointer to the highest level device object in a stack of attached device objects after incrementing the reference count on the object.




## -remarks



If the device object at <i>DeviceObject</i> has no device objects attached to it, <i>DeviceObject</i> and the returned pointer are equal.

Device driver writers must ensure that when they have completed all operations that required them to make this call, that they call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-obdereferenceobject">ObDereferenceObject</a> with the device object pointer returned by this routine. Failure to do so will prevent the system from freeing or deleting the device object because of an outstanding reference count.
