### -param Sid [out]


      A pointer to a buffer that receives the SID structure that corresponds to the <i>SidType</i> parameter. If this parameter is <b>NULL</b>, <i>SidBufferSize</i> must be zero. 
     


### -param SidBufferSize [in]

A variable that specifies the size of the <i>Sid</i> buffer in bytes.


### -param OPTIONAL

<p>An optional pointer to a variable that specifies the size of the <i>Sid</i> buffer. If the function fails because the buffer is too small or if <i>SidBufferSize</i> is zero, this variable receives the required buffer size. On success, this variable contains the size of the returned <i>Sid</i></p>

## -remarks



<b>SecLookupWellKnownSid</b> attempts to find a well known SID using a <i>SidType</i> parameter. In addition to looking up well-known SIDs on the local machine, <b>SecLookupWellKnownSid</b> can look up well-known SIDs on the local domain. <b>SecLookupWellKnownSid</b>first checks a list of well-known local SIDs. If the <i>SidType</i> does not correspond to a local well-known SID, the function checks for well-known SIDs on the primary domain. 

If the function cannot find the well known SID for the <i>SidType</i> specified, <b>SecLookupWellKnownSid</b> fails. This can occur if a network time-out prevents the function from finding the SID on the primary domain. It also occurs for a <i>SidType</i> that has no corresponding well-known SID.

<b>SecLookupWellKnownSid</b> is equivalent to the Win32   <b>CreateWellKnownSid</b> function. For user-mode applications, the WELL_KNOWN_SID_TYPE enumeration is defined in <i>winbase.h</i>.

<b>SecLookupWellKnownSid</b> is exported by the ksecdd driver, which implements this function by using user-mode helper services. Accordingly, the use of this function within file systems must obey the usual rules for communication with user-mode services. <b>SecLookupWellKnownSid</b> cannot be used during paging file I/O.
