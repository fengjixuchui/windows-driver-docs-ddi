# MmForceSectionClosed function


## -description

The <b>MmForceSectionClosed</b> routine deletes the data and image sections for a file that is no longer in use.

## -parameters

### -param SectionObjectPointer 

[in]
A pointer to a structure that contains the file object's section object pointers.

### -param DelayClose 

[in]
A Boolean value that specifies whether the section is subsequently deleted if <b>MmForceSectionClosed</b> cannot delete the section synchronously (that is, prior to <b>MmForceSectionClosed</b> returning). 

<b>TRUE</b> indicates that if <b>MmForceSectionClosed</b> cannot delete the section synchronously, <b>MmForceSectionClosed</b> sets a flag. With this flag set, when the section's outstanding reference count reaches zero, the memory manager deletes the section automatically. 

<b>FALSE</b> indicates that if <b>MmForceSectionClosed</b> cannot delete the section synchronously, the section is not deleted.

## -returns

<b>MmForceSectionClosed</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the sections were successfully deleted or no sections were found, <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If there are one or more outstanding write probes on the file's data section, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-mmflushimagesection">MmFlushImageSection</a> returns <b>FALSE</b>.</div>
<div> </div>

## -remarks
