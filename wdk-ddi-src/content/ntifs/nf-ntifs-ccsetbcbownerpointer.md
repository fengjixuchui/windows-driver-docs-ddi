# CcSetBcbOwnerPointer function


## -description


The <b>CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</b> routine sets the owner thread pointer for a pinned buffer control block (BCB).


## -parameters




### -param Bcb [in]

Pointer to a pinned BCB structure that is owned by the current thread.


### -param OwnerPointer [in]

A valid resource owner pointer, which means a pointer to an allocated system address, with the low-order two bits set. This address may not be deallocated until after the BCB is unpinned by a subsequent call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539231">CcUnpinDataForThread</a>.


## -remarks



File systems call <b>CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</b> to set the resource owner for a pinned buffer control block (BCB), in cases where another thread will unpin the BCB and thus the current thread can exit.

Each call to <b>CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</b> must be matched by a subsequent call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539231">CcUnpinDataForThread</a>, which must be called with the same owner pointer.

BCBs that have been modified by <b>CcSetBcbOwnerPointer</b> cannot be unpinned by calling <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539228">CcUnpinData</a>.
