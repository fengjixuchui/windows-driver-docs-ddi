# _FS_FILTER_SECTION_SYNC_OUTPUT structure


## -description


The  <b>FS_FILTER_SECTION_SYNC_OUTPUT</b> structure contains information describing the attributes of the section that is being created.


## -struct-fields


### -field StructureSize

The size of the structure.


### -field SizeReturned

The size of the structure which has been successfully populated with information on completion.


### -field Flags

Specifies the support for synchronization. The following values can be used:

| Name | Value | 
| -- | -- |
| FS_FILTER_SECTION_SYNC_SUPPORTS_ASYNC_PARALLEL_IO | 0x00000001 |
| FS_FILTER_SECTION_SYNC_SUPPORTS_DIRECT_MAP_DATA | 0x00000002 |
| FS_FILTER_SECTION_SYNC_SUPPORTS_DIRECT_MAP_IMAGE | 0x00000004 |



### -field DesiredReadAlignment

Specifies the optimal size for efficient reads.  Faults from the section will attempt, but not guarantee, to read in multiples of this size.  This value should be a multiple of PAGE_SIZE.
