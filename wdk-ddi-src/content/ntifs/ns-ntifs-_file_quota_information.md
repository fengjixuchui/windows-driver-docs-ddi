# _FILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION structure


## -description


The FILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION structure is used to query or set per-user quota information for each of the files in a directory. 


## -struct-fields




### -field NextEntryOffset

Offset, in bytes, of the next quota entry in the list. If there are no more entries after the current one, this member is zero. 


### -field SidLength

Length, in bytes, of the <b>Sid</b> member. 


### -field ChangeTime

Time when this quota entry was last changed. 


### -field QuotaUsed

Amount of disk space on this volume that is currently being used by the user. 


### -field QuotaThreshold

Maximum mount of disk space on this volume that can be used by the user without triggering an event. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntifs/ns-ntifs-_file_fs_control_information">FILE_FS_CONTROL_INFORMATION</a>. 


### -field QuotaLimit

Maximum amount of disk space on this volume that can be used by the user. 


### -field Sid

Security identifier (SID) of the user. 


## -remarks



No specific access rights are required to query this information. To perform this query, create an IRP with major function code IRP_MJ_QUERY_QUOTA. 

FILE_WRITE_DATA access to the volume is required to set this information. To perform this operation, create an IRP with major function code IRP_MJ_SET_QUOTA. 

To check the validity of a buffer containing FILE_QUOTA_INFORMATION structure, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntifs/nf-ntifs-iocheckquotabuffervalidity">IoCheckQuotaBufferValidity</a>. 

On 32-bit platforms, this structure must be aligned on a LONG (4-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on a 4-byte boundary. 

On 64-bit platforms, this structure must be aligned on a LONGLONG (8-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on an 8-byte boundary.
