### -param TokenObject

Handle to a token object (user mode) that was opened with TOKEN_QUERY access, or to a raw token object (kernel mode).

### -param PackageFullName

Pointer to a wide character buffer that will receive the unique package key. The buffer will be null terminated upon success.

### -param PackageSize

Pointer to the value that defines the size of the buffer that *PackageFullName* points to. On output, it will contain the written size including the terminating null.

### -param AppId

Pointer to a wide character buffer that may receive the package relative application identifier. *AppId* is optional and can be **NULL**.

### -param AppIdSize

Pointer to the value that defines the size of the buffer that *AppId* points to. On output, it will contain the written size including the terminating null. If **AppId** is not **NULL**, **AppIdSize** must point to a valid value; otherwise **AppIdSize** should set to **NULL**.

### -param DynamicId

Pointer to a value that receives a dynamic ID for the application. *DynamicId* is optional and can be **NULL**.
