# CcMdlWriteAbort function


## -description


The <b>CcMdlWriteAbort</b> routine frees memory descriptor lists (MDL) created by an earlier call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539181">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a>. 


## -parameters




### -param FileObject [in]

File object pointer that was passed to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539181">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a>. 


### -param MdlChain [in]

Address of the MDL chain returned by <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539181">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a>. 


## -remarks



File systems call <b>CcMdlWriteAbort</b> to free the memory descriptor lists (MDL) created by an earlier call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539181">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a> for a cached file. All physical pages that were locked down are unlocked. Any pages that were mapped are unmapped. 

File systems normally call <b>CcMdlWriteAbort</b> only in cases where, after a successful call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539181">CcPrepareMdlWrite</a>, it is necessary to abort or fail the subsequent MDL write operation. 

Unlike <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539172">CcMdlWriteComplete</a>, <b>CcMdlWriteAbort</b> does not cause any data to be written to the cached file.
