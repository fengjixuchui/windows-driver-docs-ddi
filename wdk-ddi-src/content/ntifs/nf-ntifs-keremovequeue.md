# KeRemoveQueue function


## -description


The <b>KeRemoveQueue</b> routine gives the calling thread a pointer to a dequeued entry from the given queue object or allows the caller to wait, up to an optional timeout interval, on the queue object. 


## -parameters




### -param Queue [in, out]

Pointer to an initialized queue object for which the caller provides resident storage in nonpaged pool.


### -param WaitMode [in]

The processor mode in which the caller is waiting, which can be either <b>KernelMode</b> or <b>UserMode</b>. If anything on its stack might be accessed at IRQL >= DISPATCH_LEVEL, the caller must specify <b>KernelMode</b>. 


### -param Timeout [in, optional]

Pointer to a variable that specifies the absolute or relative time, in units of 100 nanoseconds, at which the wait is to expire. If the value of <i>Timeout</i> is negative, the expiration time is relative to the current system time; otherwise, it is absolute. Absolute expiration times track any changes in system time; relative expiration times are not affected by system time changes. This pointer can be <b>NULL</b>. 


## -returns



<b>KeRemoveQueue</b> returns one of the following:

<ul>
<li>A pointer to a dequeued entry from the given queue object, if one is available 
</li>
<li>STATUS_TIMEOUT, if the given Timeout interval expired before an entry became available</li>
<li>STATUS_USER_APC, if a user-mode APC was delivered in the context of the calling thread</li>
<li>STATUS_ABANDONED, if the queue has been run down</li>
</ul>



## -remarks



Callers of <b>KeRemoveQueue</b> should test whether its return value is STATUS_TIMEOUT or STATUS_USER_APC before accessing any entry members. Testing the return value of <b>KeRemoveQueue</b> against <b>NULL</b> is a programming error. 

Specifying a zero value for <i>*Timeout</i> indicates the caller's unwillingness to wait for an entry if the queue is currently empty. Specifying a <b>NULL</b><i>Timeout</i> pointer indicates the caller's willingness to wait indefinitely for an entry. 

If the <i>WaitMode</i> parameter is <b>UserMode</b>, the kernel stack can be swapped out during the wait. Consequently, a caller must never attempt to pass parameters on the stack when calling <b>KeRemoveQueue</b> with <i>WaitMode</i> set to <b>UserMode</b>.

Specifying <i>WaitMode</i> as <b>KernelMode</b> in a call to <b>KeRemoveQueue</b> prevents the calling thread's kernel stack from being swapped out, as well as preventing the delivery of user-mode asynchronous procedure calls (APC). It does not prevent the delivery of kernel-mode APCs, such as those used by the I/O Manager to complete IRPs, when a thread calls <b>KeRemoveQueue</b> from IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL. Delivery of such a kernel-mode APC does not prevent the calling thread from waiting on the queue object nor from being dispatched for execution with an entry after the kernel APC has run.
