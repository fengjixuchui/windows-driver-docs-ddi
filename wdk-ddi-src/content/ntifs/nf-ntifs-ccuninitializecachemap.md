# CcUninitializeCacheMap function


## -description


The <b>CcUninitializeCacheMap</b> routine stops the caching of a cached file.


## -parameters




### -param FileObject [in]

Pointer to a file object for the cached file.


### -param TruncateSize [in, optional]

If specified, the file was truncated to the specified size, and the cache should be purged accordingly.


### -param UninitializeEvent

<p>If specified, the provided event is set to the signaled state when the cached file data has been flushed to disk.</p>




## -returns



<b>CcUninitializeCacheMap</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if caching was stopped successfully, <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.




## -remarks



All file systems that support file caching must call <b>CcUninitializeCacheMap</b> when closing a file, whether the file is cached or not. Even if the file was created with caching disabled, the file system still must call <b>CcUninitializeCacheMap</b>.

To cache a file, use <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff539135">CcInitializeCacheMap</a>.
