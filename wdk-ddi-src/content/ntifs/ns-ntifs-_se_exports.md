# _SE_EXPORTS structure


## -description


The <b>SeExports</b> structure is a large external static SE_EXPORTS structure that defines a number of well-known security constants for privilege values and security identifiers.


## -struct-fields




### -field SeCreateTokenPrivilege

The privilege that is required to create a primary access token.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Create a token object".


### -field SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege

The privilege that is required to assign the primary token of a process. The privilege allows a parent process to replace the access token that is associated with a child process.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Replace a process-level token".


### -field SeLockMemoryPrivilege

The privilege that is required to lock physical pages in memory. This privilege allows a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents the system from paging the data to virtual memory on a disk.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Required to lock physical pages in memory".


### -field SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege

The privilege that is required to increase the quota assigned to a process. The privilege allows a process that has access to a second process to increase the processor quota assigned to the second process. This privilege is useful for system tuning, but it can be abused.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Adjust memory quotas for a process".


### -field SeUnsolicitedInputPrivilege

The privilege that is required to read unsolicited input from a terminal device. This privilege is obsolete and unused. It has no effect on the system.


### -field SeTcbPrivilege

The privilege that identifies its holder as part of the trusted computer base. Typically, only low-level authentication services require this privilege. Some trusted protected subsystems are granted this privilege.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Act as part of the operating system".


### -field SeSecurityPrivilege

The privilege that is required to perform a number of security-related functions, such as controlling and viewing audit messages. This privilege identifies its holder as a security operator. This privilege allows a user to specify object access auditing options for individual resources, including files, Active Directory objects, and Registry keys. A user who has this privilege can also view and clear the security log from Event Viewer.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Manage auditing and security log".


### -field SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege

The privilege that is required to take ownership of an object without being granted discretionary access. This privilege allows the user to take ownership of any securable object in the system, including Active Directory objects, files and folders, printers, registry keys, processes, and threads. This privilege allows the owner value to be set only to those values that the holder might legitimately assign as the owner of an object. 

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Take ownership of files or other objects".


### -field SeLoadDriverPrivilege

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Create a pagefile".


### -field SeIncreaseBasePriorityPrivilege

The privilege that is required to increase the base priority of a process. This privilege allows a user to increase the base priority class of a process. Increasing relative priority within a priority class is not a privileged operation and does not need this privilege.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Increase scheduling priority".


### -field SeSystemProfilePrivilege

The privilege that is required to gather profiling information for the entire system. The privilege allows a user to sample the performance of system processes.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Profile system performance".


### -field SeSystemtimePrivilege

The privilege that is required to modify the system time. This privilege allows the user to adjust the time on the computer's internal clock. This privilege is not required to change the time zone or other display characteristics of the system time.

### -field SeProfileSingleProcessPrivilege

The privilege that is required to gather profiling information for a single process. The privilege allows a user to sample the performance of an application process.

User-mode applications represent this privilege as the following user-right string: "Profile single process".

Any access request other than read is still evaluated with the ACL. This privilege is required by the user-mode <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regsavekeya">RegSaveKey</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regsavekeyexa">RegSaveKeyEx</a> routines.

This privilege causes the system to grant all write access control to any file, regardless of the ACL specified for the file. Any access request other than write is still evaluated with the ACL. Additionally, this privilege enables you to set any valid user or group SID as the owner of a file. This privilege is required by the user-mode <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regloadkeya">RegLoadKey</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regunloadkeya">RegUnLoadKey</a> routines that add or remove a hive from the registry.
