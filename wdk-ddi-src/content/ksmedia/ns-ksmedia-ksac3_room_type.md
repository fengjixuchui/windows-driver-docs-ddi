# KSAC3_ROOM_TYPE structure


## -description


The KSAC3_ROOM_TYPE structure specifies the type of audio mixing room in which an AC-3-encoded stream was produced.


## -struct-fields




### -field fLargeRoom

Specifies the type and calibration of the mixing room used for the final audio mixing session. If <b>TRUE</b>, a large room with an X curve (described in the AC-3 specification; for more information, see the following Remarks section) was used. If <b>FALSE</b>, a small room with a flat curve was used.


## -remarks



This structure characterizes the production environment of an AC-3-encoded stream. The information in the structure is not typically used by the decoder, but might be used by other audio components after decoding.

This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/ksproperty-ac3-room-type">KSPROPERTY_AC3_ROOM_TYPE</a> property.

For more information about room types, see the AC-3 specification at the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8730">Dolby Laboratories</a> website. The specification is titled Digital Audio Compression Standard (AC-3).
