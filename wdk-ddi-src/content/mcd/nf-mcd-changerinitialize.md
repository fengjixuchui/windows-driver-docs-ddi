# ChangerInitialize function


## -description


<b>ChangerInitialize</b> readies the changer to receive other requests. 


## -parameters




### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the device object created by the changer class driver to represent this changer. 


## -returns



<b>ChangerInitialize</b> returns the STATUS_<i>XXX</i> value returned by the system port driver or one of the following values:
      

STATUS_SUCCESS

STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES




## -remarks



The changer class driver calls <b>ChangerInitialize</b> during driver initialization, after creating a device object to represent a changer. 

<b>ChangerInitialize</b> performs any device-specific processing required to get the changer ready to receive requests. It also typically stores device-specific information in the device extension, such as SCSI inquiry data or the non-SCSI equivalent and offsets to generate zero-based element addresses, which are used by the system to refer to changer elements.

After <b>ChangerInitialize</b> returns, the changer miniclass driver and the changer should be able to handle any other request.
