## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]

This hint indicates if the OEM Battery Manager should attempt to save as much charge as possible in the non-hot swappable batteries (i.e. the batteries are generally referred to as "internal batteries", these batteries cannot be removed while system is operational).


## -struct-fields

### -field Version

Set to HPMI_BATTERY_UTILIZATION_HINT_VERSION_1.

### -field PreserveNonHotSwappableBatteries

 Interpretation of values:

- HpmiBoolUnavailable: Battery utilization hint is unavailable at the moment.

- HpmiBoolFalse: It is not necessary to preserve charge in the internal batteries at the moment.

- HpmiBoolTrue: Every attempt should be made to save as much charge as possible in the internal batteries.
