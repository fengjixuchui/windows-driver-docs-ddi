# _URS_HARDWARE_EVENT enumeration


## -description


Defines values for the hardware events that a client driver for a USB dual-role controller can report.


## -enum-fields




### -field UrsHardwareEventNone

Internal use only. 


### -field UrsHardwareEventDetach

A detach event occurred on a port of a USB Type-C system. 


### -field UrsHardwareEventIdGround

This event indicates that the ID pin is grounded.


### -field UrsHardwareEventIdFloat

This event indicates that the ID pin is floating.


### -field UrsHardwareEventPortTypeDfp

The Type-C connector has resolved to DFP. Not to be used directly by the URS client driver.


### -field UrsHardwareEventPortTypeUfp

The Type-C connector has resolved to UFP. Not to be used directly by the URS client driver.


## -remarks



Values defined for USB Type-C systems should not be directly used by the client driver. Instead the driver should report that it does not support hardware event reporting by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ursdevice/nf-ursdevice-urssethardwareeventsupport">UrsSetHardwareEventSupport</a>. These hardware events are detected by a USB Type-C connector driver, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ucmmanager/">USB Type-C connector driver programming reference</a>.
