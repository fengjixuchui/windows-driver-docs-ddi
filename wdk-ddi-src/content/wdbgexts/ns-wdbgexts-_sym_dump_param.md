# _SYM_DUMP_PARAM structure


## -description


The IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/nc-wdbgexts-pwindbg_ioctl_routine">Ioctl</a> operation provides information about the type of a symbol.  When calling <b>Ioctl</b> with <i>IoctlType</i> set to IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO, <i>IpvData</i> should contain an instance of the SYM_DUMP_PARAM structure.


## -struct-fields




### -field size

Specifies the size, in bytes, of this structure.  It should be set to <code>sizeof(SYM_DUMP_PARAM)</code>.


### -field sName

Specifies the name of the symbol to lookup.


### -field Options

Specifies the flags that determine the behavior of this <b>Ioctl</b> operation.  For a description of these flags, see Remarks.


### -field addr

Specifies the address of the symbol.


### -field listLink

Specifies the field that contains the next item in a linked list.  If the symbol is an entry in a linked list, this <b>Ioctl</b> operation can iterate over the items in the list using the field specified here as the pointer to the next item in the list.  The type of this structure is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/ns-wdbgexts-_field_info">FIELD_INFO</a>.

The callback function specified in the <b>fieldCallBack</b> member of this structure is called, during this <b>Ioctl</b> operation, for each item in the list.  When it is called, it is passed this <b>linkList</b> structure with the members filled in for the list entry along with the contents of the <b>Context</b> member.

DBG_DUMP_LIST should be set in <b>Options</b> to tell this <b>Ioctl</b> to iterate over the list.


### -field Context

Specifies a pointer that is passed to the callback function in the <b>CallbackRoutine</b> member and to the callback functions in the <b>fieldCallBack</b> member of the <b>linkList</b> and <b>Fields</b> members.


### -field pBuffer

Specifies a buffer that receives information about the symbol.  This buffer is only used if the DBG_DUMP_COPY_TYPE_DATA flag is set in <b>Options</b>.  The size of this buffer is specified in <b>BufferSize</b>.


### -field CallbackRoutine

Specifies a callback function that is called by the engine.  The engine provides the callback function with information about the symbol and its members.


### -field nFields

Specifies the number of entries in the <b>Fields</b> array.


### -field Fields

Specifies an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/ns-wdbgexts-_field_info">FIELD_INFO</a> structures that control the behavior of this operation for individual members of the specified symbol. See FIELD_INFO for details.


### -field ModBase

Receives the location in the target's memory of the start of the module that contains the symbol.


### -field TypeId

Receives the type ID of the symbol.


### -field TypeSize

Receives the size, in bytes, of the symbol in the target's memory.


### -field BufferSize

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>pBuffer</b> buffer.


### -field fPointer

Receives a Boolean value that indicates whether the symbol is a pointer.  <b>fPointer</b> is <b>FALSE</b> if the symbol is not a pointer.  It is 1 if the symbol is a 32-bit pointer and 3 if the symbol is a 64-bit pointer.


### -field fArray

Receives a Boolean value that indicates whether the symbol is an array.  <b>fArray</b> is <b>FALSE</b> if the symbol is not an array and <b>TRUE</b> if it is.


### -field fStruct

Receives a Boolean value that indicates whether the symbol is a structure.  <b>fStruct</b> is <b>FALSE</b> if the symbol is not a structure and <b>TRUE</b> if it is.


### -field fConstant

Receives a Boolean value that indicates whether the symbol is a constant.  <b>fConstant</b> is <b>FALSE</b> if the symbol is not a constant and <b>TRUE</b> if it is.


### -field Reserved


## -remarks



The parameters for the IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/nc-wdbgexts-pwindbg_ioctl_routine">Ioctl</a> operation are the members of the SYM_DUMP_PARAM structure.

This <b>Ioctl</b> operation looks up the module information for the symbol, loading module symbols if possible.

If <b>nFields</b> is zero and DBG_DUMP_CALL_FOR_EACH is set in <b>Options</b>, the callback function specified in <b>CallbackRoutine</b> is called for every field in the symbol.

If <b>nFields</b> is non-zero and DBG_DUMP_CALL_FOR_EACH is set in <b>Options</b>, callbacks are only made for those fields matching the <b>fName</b> member of one of the <b>Fields</b> elements.  If a field matches a <b>fName</b> member and the <b>fieldCallBack</b> member is not <b>NULL</b>, the callback function in  <b>fieldCallBack</b> is called; if it is <b>NULL</b>, the callback function in <b>CallbackRoutine</b> is called instead.

<h3><a id="ddk_dbg_dump_xxx_dbx"></a><a id="DDK_DBG_DUMP_XXX_DBX"></a></h3>
The DBG_DUMP_<i>XXX</i> bit flags are used by the <b>Options</b> member of the SYM_DUMP_PARAM structure to control the behavior of the <b>IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO</b><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/nc-wdbgexts-pwindbg_ioctl_routine">Ioctl</a> operation.
