## -description

The <b>PWINDBG_WRITE_PROCESS_MEMORY_ROUTINE</b> (<b>WriteMemory</b>) function works like the Win32 <b>WriteProcessMemory</b> routine. It writes memory to the process being debugged. The entire area to be written must be accessible, or the operation fails.

## -parameters

### -param offset

Specifies the base address of the memory to be written in the process that is being debugged.

### -param lpBuffer

### -param cb

Specifies the number of bytes that <b>WriteMemory</b> should write.

### -param lpcbBytesWritten

Receives the actual number of bytes that <b>WriteMemory</b> transferred from the buffer. This parameter is optional; if it is <b>NULL</b>, it is ignored.


#### - lpbuffer

Points to the buffer that contains the data to be written.

## -returns

If the routine succeeds, the return value is <b>TRUE</b>; otherwise, it is <b>FALSE</b>.

## -remarks

For a WdbgExts extension, include wdbgexts.h. For a DbgEng extension, include wdbgexts.h before dbgeng.h. See <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/writing-dbgeng-extension-code">Writing DbgEng Extension Code</a> for details.
