# _FIELD_INFO structure


## -description

The <b>FIELD_INFO</b> structure is used by the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/ns-wdbgexts-_sym_dump_param">IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO</a>
<a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/nc-wdbgexts-pwindbg_ioctl_routine">Ioctl</a> operation to provide information about a member in a structure.

## -struct-fields

### -field fName

Specifies the name of the symbol's member to which this structure applies.  Submembers can be specified using the delimiters "<b>.</b>" and "<b>-></b>".  Unless DBG_DUMP_FIELD_FULL_NAME is set in <b>fOptions</b>, <b>fName</b> is considered to be the beginning of the member name.

### -field printName

Specifies an alternative name to use when printing the name of the member.  If <b>printName</b> is <b>NULL</b>, the actual name of the member is used when printing the name of the member.

### -field size

Receives the size in the target's memory, in bytes, of the member that is specified by <b>fName</b>.

If the member is an array, <b>size</b> specifies the number of elements in the array.

### -field fOptions

Specifies the flags that determine the behavior of the IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO <b>Ioctl</b> operation.  For a description of these flags, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/dbg-dump-field-xxx">DBG_DUMP_FIELD_XXX</a>.

### -field address

Receives the address in the target's memory of the member that is specified by <b>fName</b>.  If no address is supplied for the symbol type in SYM_DUMP_PARAM.<b>addr</b>, <b>address</b> receives the offset of the member relative to the beginning of an instance of the type.  For more information about SYM_DUMP_PARAM, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/ns-wdbgexts-_sym_dump_param">IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO</a>.

### -field fieldCallBack

Specifies a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/nc-wdbgexts-psym_dump_field_callback">PSYM_DUMP_FIELD_CALLBACK</a> callback function to be called with the information about the member that is specified by <b>fName</b>.  The callback function is passed a structure with the field information and the value of SYM_DUMP_PARAM.<b>context</b>.

No callback function is called if DBG_DUMP_FIELD_NO_CALLBACK_REQ is set in <b>fOptions</b>, <b>fieldCallBack</b> is <b>NULL</b>, or the <b>Options</b> member of the SYM_DUMP_PARAM structure passed to <b>Ioctl</b> does not have DBG_DUMP_CALL_FOR_EACH set.  If DBG_DUMP_FIELD_COPY_FIELD_DATA is set in <b>fOptions</b>, <b>fieldCallBack</b> is not used.

### -field pBuffer

Specifies a buffer to receive the value of the member specified by <b>fName</b>.  This member is only used if DBG_DUMP_FIELD_COPY_FIELD_DATA is set in <b>fOptions</b>.

### -field TypeId

Receives the identifier for the type of the member that is specified by <b>fName</b>.

### -field FieldOffset

Receives the offset of the member within the structure.

### -field BufferSize

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the <b>pBuffer</b> buffer.

### -field BitField

Receives information about bit fields in a structure.

### -field BitField.Position

Receives the start position of the bit field.  This is the number of bits from to the beginning of the structure to the bit field.

### -field BitField.Size

Receives the size, in bits, of the bit field.

### -field _BitField

Receives information about bit fields in a structure.

### -field fPointer

Receives a Boolean value that indicates whether the member is a pointer.  <b>fPointer</b> is <b>FALSE</b> if the member is not a pointer.  It is 1 if the member is a 32-bit pointer and 3 if the member is a 64-bit pointer.

### -field fArray

Receives a Boolean value that indicates whether the member is an array.  <b>fArray</b> is <b>FALSE</b> if the field is not an array and <b>TRUE</b> if it is.

### -field fStruct

Receives a Boolean value that indicates whether the member is a structure.  <b>fStruct</b> is <b>FALSE</b> if the member is not a structure and <b>TRUE</b> if it is.

### -field fConstant

Receives a Boolean value that indicates whether the member is a constant.  <b>fConstant</b> is <b>FALSE</b> if the member is not a constant and <b>TRUE</b> if it is.

### -field fStatic

### -field Reserved

## -remarks

When calling the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/ns-wdbgexts-_sym_dump_param">IG_DUMP_SYMBOL_INFO</a>
<a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/nc-wdbgexts-pwindbg_ioctl_routine">Ioctl</a> operation, the <b>fName</b> member of this structure should be set to the name of the symbol's member to which this structure applies and the <b>fOptions</b> member should reflect the desired functionality of the operation.  The other members are either optional, or are filled in by <b>Ioctl</b>.
