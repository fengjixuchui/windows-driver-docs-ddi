# IOCTL_BTHX_WRITE_HCI IOCTL


## -description

IOCTL_BTHX_WRITE_HCI is used to write Bluetooth ACL Data and Commands to the transport layer.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

Profile drivers should use KMDF and its <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestretrieveinputmemory">WdfRequestRetrieveInputMemory</a> method to retrieve input parameters.  For example, to get the input buffer:

<code>Status = WdfRequestRetrieveInputMemory(_Request, &ReqInMemory);</code>

The buffer describes a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/bthxddi/ns-bthxddi-_bthx_hci_read_write_context">BTHX_HCI_READ_WRITE_CONTEXT</a> structure that specifies the type of write and the data associated with the write. 

Refer to the WDK Bluetooth samples for more information.

### -input-buffer-length

The length of the buffer is the size of the <b>BTHX_HCI_READ_WRITE_CONTEXT</b> structure.

### -output-buffer

Profile drivers should use KMDF and its <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestretrieveoutputmemory">WdfRequestRetrieveOutputMemory</a> method to retrieve input parameters.  For example, to get the output buffer:

<code>Status = WdfRequestRetrieveOutputMemory(_Request, &ReqOutMemory);</code>

The buffer describes a ULONG of the number of bytes written for the input data specified in the <b>BTHX_HCI_READ_WRITE_CONTEXT</b> structure. 

Refer to the WDK Bluetooth samples for more information.

### -output-buffer-length

The length of the buffer is the size of a ULONG.

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

If the request is successful the 
      <b>Information</b> member of the STATUS_BLOCK structure is set to the number of bytes in the Output Parameter.

The 
      <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the values in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STATUS_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
The IOCTL completed successfully.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

The Bluetooth stack sends IOCTL_BTHX_WRITE_HCI to write HCI ACL data and HCI command to the controller.

The input buffer points to a BTHX_HCI_READ_WRITE_CONTEXT structure whose <b>DataLen</b> member specifies the number of bytes in the <b>Data</b> member. The <b>Type</b> member is set based on whether the packet is a command packet or an ACL data packet.
