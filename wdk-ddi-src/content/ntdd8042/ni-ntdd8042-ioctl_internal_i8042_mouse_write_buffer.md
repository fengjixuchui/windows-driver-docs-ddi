# IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_MOUSE_WRITE_BUFFER IOCTL


## -description



The IOCTL_INTERNAL_I8042_MOUSE_WRITE_BUFFER request writes data to the i8042 port controller to control operation of a mouse device. An upper-level filter driver can use this request to control the operation of a mouse.

I8042prt synchronizes write buffer requests with one another. I8042prt synchronizes the actual write of data with the mouse ISR.




## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.Type3InputBuffer</b> points to a client-allocated buffer that supplies the data to write to an i8042 port controller.


### -input-buffer-length

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> is set to the number of bytes in the input buffer, which must be greater than 1.


### -output-buffer

None


### -output-buffer-length

None


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the following values:




**STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY**

The mouse interrupt is not initialized.


**STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER**

The input parameters are not valid.


**STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT**

The request timed out.


**STATUS_SUCCESS**

The request completed successfully.
