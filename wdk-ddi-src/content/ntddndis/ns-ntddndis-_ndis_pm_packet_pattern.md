# _NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN structure


## -description


The NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN structure specifies a wake-up pattern, which, when detected by a network adapter that
  has pattern-match enabled, causes the network adapter to signal a power-management wake-up event.


## -struct-fields




### -field Priority

This member is reserved.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved.


### -field MaskSize

Specifies the size in bytes of the pattern mask that immediately follows the
     NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN structure in the 
     <i>InformationBuffer</i>.


### -field PatternOffset

Specifies in bytes the offset from the beginning of the 
     <i>InformationBuffer</i> to the start of the wake-up pattern.


### -field PatternSize

Specifies in bytes the size of the wake-up pattern.


### -field PatternFlags

These flags are reserved.


## -remarks



NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN is supplied in the 
    <i>InformationBuffer</i> of the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_oid_request">NDIS_OID_REQUEST</a> structure for following
    OIDs:

<ul>
<li>

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-pnp-add-wake-up-pattern">OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN</a>


A protocol driver sends this OID to a miniport driver to specify a wake-up pattern. The wake-up
      pattern, along with its mask, is described by an NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN structure.

</li>
<li>

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-pnp-remove-wake-up-pattern">
       OID_PNP_REMOVE_WAKE_UP_PATTERN</a>


A protocol driver sends this OID to a miniport driver to delete a wake-up pattern that it previously
      specified with an OID_PNP_ADD_WAKE_UP_PATTERN request. The wake-up pattern, along with its mask, is
      described by an NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN structure.

</li>
<li>

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-pnp-wake-up-pattern-list">OID_PNP_WAKE_UP_PATTERN_LIST</a>


A protocol uses this OID to request a list of the wake-up patterns currently set for the miniport
      driver's network adapter. Each wake-up pattern, along with its mask, is described by an NDIS_PM_PACKET_PATTERN
      structure.

</li>
</ul>
