# _NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_MOVE_FILTER_PARAMETERS structure


## -description


The <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_MOVE_FILTER_PARAMETERS</b> structure specifies the parameters for moving a previously created receive filter. A receive filter is moved  from a receive queue on a virtual port (VPort) to a receive queue on another VPort.


## -struct-fields




### -field Header

The type, revision, and size of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_MOVE_FILTER_PARAMETERS</b> structure. This member is formatted as an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure.

The miniport driver must set the <b>Type</b> member of <b>Header</b> to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_DEFAULT. To specify the version of the <b>NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_MOVE_FILTER_PARAMETERS</b> structure, the driver must set the <b>Revision</b> member of <b>Header</b> to the following value: 





#### NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_MOVE_FILTER_PARAMETERS_REVISION_1

Original version for NDIS 6.30 and later.

Set the <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_RECEIVE_FILTER_MOVE_FILTER_PARAMETERS_REVISION_1.


### -field FilterId

An NDIS_RECEIVE_FILTER_ID value that  specifies the identifier of the receive filter.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>   The filter specified by this value must have been previously set through an OID method request of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-receive-filter-set-filter">OID_RECEIVE_FILTER_SET_FILTER</a>.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field SourceQueueId

An NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_ID value that specifies the identifier of the receive queue on which this filter was previously set. For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -field SourceVPortId

An NDIS_NIC_SWITCH_VPORT_ID value that specifies the identifier of the VPort on which this filter was previously set.


### -field DestQueueId

An NDIS_RECEIVE_QUEUE_ID value that specifies the identifier of the receive queue on which the filter is to be moved. For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -field DestVPortId

An NDIS_NIC_SWITCH_VPORT_ID value that specifies the identifier of the VPort on which this filter is to be moved.


## -remarks



This structure is used in OID set requests of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-receive-filter-move-filter">OID_RECEIVE_FILTER_MOVE_FILTER</a>.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Starting with NDIS 6.30, the single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) interface allows receive filters to be set only  on the default receive queue on both default and nondefault VPorts. The <b>SourceQueueId</b> and <b>DestQueueId</b> members must always be set to NDIS_DEFAULT_RECEIVE_QUEUE_ID.</div>
<div> </div>
