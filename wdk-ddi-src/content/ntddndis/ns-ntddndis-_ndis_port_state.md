# _NDIS_PORT_STATE structure


## -description


The NDIS_PORT_STATE structure specifies the port state information for an NDIS port.


## -struct-fields




### -field Header

The 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddndis/ns-ntddndis-_ndis_object_header">NDIS_OBJECT_HEADER</a> structure for the
     NDIS_PORT_STATE structure. Set the 
     <b>Type</b> member of the structure that 
     <b>Header</b> specifies to NDIS_OBJECT_TYPE_ DEFAULT, the 
     <b>Revision</b> member to NDIS_PORT_STATE_REVISION_1, and the 
     <b>Size</b> member to NDIS_SIZEOF_PORT_STATE_REVISION_1.


### -field MediaConnectState

The media connection state of the port. This state is the same information that the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-gen-media-connect-status-ex">
     OID_GEN_MEDIA_CONNECT_STATUS_EX</a> OID returns.


### -field XmitLinkSpeed

The transmit link speed of the port, in bits per second. A value of -1 in this member indicates
     that the transmit link speed is unknown.


### -field RcvLinkSpeed

The receive link speed of the port, in bits per second. A value of -1 in this member indicates
     that the receive link speed is unknown.


### -field Direction

A 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ifdef/ne-ifdef-_net_if_direction_type">NET_IF_DIRECTION_TYPE</a> NDIS network
     interface direction type.


### -field SendControlState

The current control state of the port for send operations. This member must contain one of the
     following values:
     





#### NdisPortControlStateUnknown

The port's control state for send operations is unknown.



#### NdisPortControlStateControlled

The port is in a controlled state for send operations. That is, the port requires
       authorization.



#### NdisPortControlStateUncontrolled

The port is in an uncontrolled state for send operations. That is, the port does not require
       authorization.


### -field RcvControlState

The current control state of the port for receive operations. This member must contain one of the
     following values:
     





#### NdisPortControlStateUnknown

The port's control state for receive operations is unknown.



#### NdisPortControlStateControlled

The port is in a controlled state for receive operations. That is, the port requires
       authorization.



#### NdisPortControlStateUncontrolled

The port is in an uncontrolled state for receive operations. That is, the port does not require
       authorization.


### -field SendAuthorizationState

The current authorization state of the port for send operations. Ignore this member if the 
     <b>SendControlState</b> member is set to 
     <b>NdisPortControlStateUncontrolled</b>.
     

<b>SendAuthorizationState</b> must contain one of the following values:





#### NdisPortAuthorizationUnknown

The port's authorization state for send operations is unknown.



#### NdisPortAuthorized

The port is authorized for send operations.



#### NdisPortUnauthorized

The port is not authorized for send operations.



#### NdisPortReauthorizing

The port is re-authorizing for send operations.


### -field RcvAuthorizationState

The current authorization state of the port for receive operations. Ignore this member if the 
     <b>RcvControlState</b> member is set to 
     <b>NdisPortControlStateUncontrolled</b>.
     

<b>RcvAuthorizationState</b> must contain one of the following values:





#### NdisPortAuthorizationUnknown

The port's authorization state for receive operations is unknown.



#### NdisPortAuthorized

The port is authorized for receive operations.



#### NdisPortUnauthorized

The port is not authorized for receive operations.



#### NdisPortReauthorizing

The port is re-authorizing for receive operations.


### -field Flags

Reserved for NDIS.


## -remarks



The NDIS_PORT_STATE structure is used in the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/ndis-status-port-state">NDIS_STATUS_PORT_STATE</a> status
    indication to indicate a change in the state of a port and is used in response to an 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-gen-port-state">OID_GEN_PORT_STATE</a> OID query.
