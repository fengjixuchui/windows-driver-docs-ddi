# ISensorDriver::OnGetSupportedEvents


## -description


The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorsclassextension/nf-sensorsclassextension-isensordriver-ongetsupportedevents">ISensorDriver::OnGetSupportedEvents</a> method retrieves the list of events that the specified sensor can raise.


## -parameters




### -param pwszSensorID

LPWSTR that contains the ID for the sensor from which the client application is requesting the events list.


### -param ppSupportedEvents

Address of a GUID pointer that receives the array of supported event IDs. If the driver does not support events, return a buffer containing a single GUID that has its value set to GUID_NULL.


### -param pulEventCount

Address of a ULONG that receives the count of event IDs in the buffer returned through ppSupportedEvents. If the driver does not support events, set this value to zero.


## -returns



If the operation succeeds, this method returns S_OK. Otherwise, this method returns one of the error codes that are defined in Winerror.h.




## -remarks



Event IDs are represented by <b>GUID</b>s. Platform-defined events are defined in sensors.h. 

You must use CoTaskMemAlloc to create the event ID buffer. The sensor class extension frees this memory.
