# MagnetometerAccuracy enumeration


## -description

Specifies the accuracy of the magnetometer.

## -enum-fields

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_UNKNOWN

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_UNRELIABLE

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_APPROXIMATE

### -field MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY_HIGH

#### - Approximate

          The actual and reported values differ but may be accurate enough for some applications. Apps that only need a relative value, like a virtual reality app, can continue without additional calibration.


#### - High

          The actual and reported values are accurate. No additional calibration is needed.


#### - Unknown

The accuracy is currently not available, typically because the driver can't report it.


#### - Unreliable

The reported values have a high degree of inaccuracy. Apps should always ask the user to calibrate the device whenever this value is returned.

## -remarks

Device drivers that support magnetometer accuracy should only report the <b>Unreliable</b>, <b>Approximate</b>, and <b>High</b> values.

Apps that need calibration may periodically ask the user to calibrate the device. We suggest doing this once every 10 minutes.
