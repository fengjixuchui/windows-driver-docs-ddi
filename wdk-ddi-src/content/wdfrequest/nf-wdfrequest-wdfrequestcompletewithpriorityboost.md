# WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]</p>

The <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> method completes a specified I/O request and supplies a completion status. It also specifies a value that the system can use to boost the run-time priority of the thread that requested the I/O operation.


## -parameters




### -param Request [in]

A handle to the framework request object that represents the I/O request that is being completed.


### -param Status [in]

An <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values">NTSTATUS value</a> that represents the completion status of the request. Valid status values include, but are not limited to, the following:





#### STATUS_SUCCESS

The driver successfully completed the request.



#### STATUS_CANCELLED

The driver canceled the request.



#### STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL

The driver encountered an error while processing the request.


### -param PriorityBoost [in]

A system-defined constant value by which to increment the run-time priority of the original thread that requested the operation. Constant values are device-type-specific and are defined in <i>Wdm.h</i>. The format for the constant names is <i>XXX</i>_INCREMENT. For more information about priority boost values, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/specifying-priority-boosts-when-completing-i-o-requests">Specifying Priority Boosts When Completing I/O Requests</a>.


## -returns



None.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.






## -remarks



Your driver should call <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> if you want to override the default priority boost that the framework provides. For example, the driver might set the priority boost to IO_NO_INCREMENT if it was able to complete the request quickly, perhaps because it detected an error. 

After a call to <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> returns, the request handle is no longer valid unless the driver has called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/wdfobjectreference">WdfObjectReference</a> to add one or more additional reference counts to the request object. Note that after <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> returns, the driver must not attempt to access the associated WDM IRP structure, even if it has called <b>WdfObjectReference</b>.

For more information about calling <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b>, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/completing-i-o-requests">Completing I/O Requests</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example shows how the example at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestcomplete">WdfRequestComplete</a> can use <b>WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost</b> instead of <b>WdfRequestComplete</b>.
