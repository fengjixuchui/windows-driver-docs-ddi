# WdfRequestSetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to UMDF only]</p>

The <b>WdfRequestSetUserModeDriverInitiatedIo</b> method indicates to kernel-mode drivers that sit below the UMDF driver in the same device stack that a particular request should be treated as though it came from a UMDF driver.


## -parameters




### -param Request [in]

A handle to a framework request object.


### -param IsUserModeDriverInitiated [in]

A Boolean value that, if <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the request should be treated as though it was initiated by a UMDF driver. If <b>FALSE</b>, this parameter indicates that the request should be treated as though it came from an application.


## -returns



This method does not return a value.




## -remarks



If a UMDF driver calls this method with the <i>IsUserModeDriverInitiated</i> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b>, the framework sets the <b>IRP_UM_DRIVER_INITIATED_IO</b> flag in the <b>Flags</b> member of the WDM <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_irp">IRP</a> structure before forwarding the request to kernel-mode drivers.

A kernel-mode driver that resides below the UMDF driver in the same device stack can check for this flag to determine if the request should be treated as though initiated by a UMDF driver.

This flag is not applicable to kernel-mode drivers that might receive a request from a UMDF driver via a file-handle I/O target or a Win32 I/O target.

A UMDF driver might set the <i>IsUserModeDriverInitiated</i> parameter to <b>TRUE</b> for a request that came from an application if the driver has validated the request.

Requests that the driver created on its own are already marked as having originated from a UMDF driver.
