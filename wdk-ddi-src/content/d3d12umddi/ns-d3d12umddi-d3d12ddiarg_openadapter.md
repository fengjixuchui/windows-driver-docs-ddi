# D3D12DDIARG_OPENADAPTER structure


## -description


The D3D12DDIARG_OPENADAPTER structure describes the graphics adapter object.


## -struct-fields




### -field hRTAdapter

[in] A runtime handle to the graphics adapter object that specifies the handle that the driver should use to query for graphics adapter capabilities when the driver calls the Microsoft Direct3D runtime-supplied <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryadapterinfocb">pfnQueryAdapterInfoCb</a> callback function. 


### -field hAdapter

[out] A handle to the graphics adapter object that specifies the handle that the Direct3D runtime uses in subsequent driver calls to identify the graphics adapter object. The driver generates a unique handle and passes it back to the Direct3D runtime. 


### -field pAdapterCallbacks

[in] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_adaptercallbacks">D3DDDI_ADAPTERCALLBACKS</a> structure that contains the Direct3D runtime-supplied <b>pfnQueryAdapterInfoCb</b> callback function that the driver can use.


### -field pAdapterFuncs

[out] A pointer to a D3D12DDI_ADAPTERFUNCS structure that contains a table of user-mode display driver adapter-specific functions. The Direct3D runtime uses these functions to communicate with the user-mode display driver about operations that are specific to the graphics adapter.
