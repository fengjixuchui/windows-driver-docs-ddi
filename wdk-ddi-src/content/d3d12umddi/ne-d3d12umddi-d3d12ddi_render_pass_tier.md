# D3D12DDI_RENDER_PASS_TIER enumeration

## -description

The extent to which a UMD (user mode driver) efficiently supports Render Pass.

## -enum-fields

### -field D3D12DDI_RENDER_PASS_TIER_NOT_SUPPORTED

The UMD has not implemented a DDI Table, which is supported via software emulation.

### -field D3D12DDI_RENDER_PASS_TIER_1

Render Passes implemented by UMD, RT/DB writes may be accelerated. UAV (user access view) writes are not efficiently supported within the Render Pass.

### -field D3D12DDI_RENDER_PASS_TIER_2

Includes Tier 1, plus UAV writes, pursuant to the read-after-write prohibition, are likely to be efficiently supported. This is more efficient than issuing the same work without a Render Pass.

## -remarks

The UMD will report back these tiers to the runtime. The runtime will validate that UMDs which fill out the DDI table at least report back TIER_1, and at the same time will validate that UMDs which do not fill out the DDI table do not claim anything other than TIER_0 support (the runtime will fail device creation in this case).

> [!NOTE]
> This requirement will only be present for UMDs that support a the DDI build version in which this change is made.
