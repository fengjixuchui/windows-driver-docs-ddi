# PFND3D12DDI_QUEUEPROCESSINGWORK_CB_0062 callback function

## -description

*PfnQueueProcessingWorkCb* is provided by the runtime and called by user mode drivers to register and queue work items. 

The runtime is responsible for managing threads, either directly, or through a Thread Pool. The UMD will not have any control over which thread the work is processed on. Work will be processed in the order it was received. *PfnQueueProcessingWorkCb* may be called from multiple threads concurrently and is thread safe (runtime will serialize).

## -parameters

### -param hRTDevice

[in] The handle of the device for the driver to use when it calls back into the runtime.

### -param pfnCallback

[in] Pointer to a [PFND3D12DDI_UMD_CALLBACK_METHOD](nc-d3d12umddi-pfnd3d12ddi_umd_callback_method.md) callback that is called from the thread where work is being performed.

### -param pfnCancel

[in, opt] Pointer to a [PFND3D12DDI_UMD_CALLBACK_METHOD](nc-d3d12umddi-pfnd3d12ddi_umd_callback_method.md) callback that is called if the device is destroyed before *pfnCallback* has executed.

### -param pContext

[in, opt] Pointer to a device context that is passed to *pfnCallback* or *pfnCancel*.

## -returns

Returns HRESULT.
