# D3D12DDIARG_CREATEDEVICE_0003 structure


## -description


The D3D10DDIARG_CREATEDEVICE_0003 structure describes the display device to create.


## -struct-fields




### -field hRTDevice

[in] A handle to the display device (graphics context) that specifies the handle that the driver should use when it calls back into the Direct3D runtime. 


### -field Interface

[in] The Direct3D interface version.


### -field Version

[in] A UINT value that the driver can use to identify when the Direct3D runtime was built (the runtime version).


### -field pKTCallbacks

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_devicecallbacks">D3DDDI_DEVICECALLBACKS</a> structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access kernel services.


### -field hDrvDevice

 A handle to the display device (graphics context) that the Direct3D runtime uses in subsequent driver calls to identify the display device.


### -field p12UMCallbacks

 A pointer to a D3D12DDI_CORELAYER_DEVICECALLBACKS_0003 structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access core user-mode runtime functionality. 


### -field p12UMCallbacks_0022

A pointer to a [D3D12DDI_CORELAYER_DEVICECALLBACKS_0022](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_corelayer_devicecallbacks_0022.md) structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access core user-mode runtime functionality. 

### -field p12UMCallbacks_0050

A pointer to a [D3D12DDI_CORELAYER_DEVICECALLBACKS_0050](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_corelayer_devicecallbacks_0050.md) structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access core user-mode runtime functionality.

### -field Flags

Flag values that identify how to create the display device.
