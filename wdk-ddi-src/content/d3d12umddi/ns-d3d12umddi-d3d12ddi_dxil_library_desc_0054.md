# D3D12DDI_DXIL_LIBRARY_DESC_0054 structure


## -description

Describes the DXIL (DirectX Intermediate Language) library.

## -struct-fields

### -field pDXILLibrary

Pointer to a DXIL library.

### -field NumExports

Optional. The number of exports in the DXIL library. If 0, all exports in the library/collection will be surfaced.

### -field pExports

 
Pointer to an array of [D3D12DDI_EXPORT_DESC_0054](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_export_desc_0054.md).

## -remarks

If there are multiple explicit subject associations with different subobject definitions that map to a given shader export, this is a conflict.  If a conflict is discovered during DXIL library creation, library creation will fail. Otherwise if a conflict is discovered during state object creation, that fails.
