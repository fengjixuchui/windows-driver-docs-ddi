# D3D12DDI_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC_0025 structure

## -description

The D3D12DDI_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC_0025 structure describes a depth stencil state.

## -struct-fields

### -field DepthEnable

A Boolean value that specifies whether depth is enabled. TRUE indicates depth is enabled; FALSE indicates depth is disabled. 

### -field DepthWriteMask

A bitwise value that indicates the write properties for a depth stencil state. This member is a valid bitwise OR of the following values from the [D3D12DDI_DEPTH_WRITE_MASK](ne-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_depth_write_mask.md) enumeration.

### -field DepthFunc

A [D3D12DDI_COMPARISON_FUNC](ne-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_comparison_func.md)-typed value that indicates the depth-comparison function to perform.

### -field StencilEnable

A Boolean value that specifies whether stencil is enabled. TRUE indicates stencil is enabled; FALSE indicates stencil is disabled. 

### -field FrontEnable

A Boolean value that specifies whether the performance of stencil operations on forward-facing polygons is enabled. TRUE indicates that the performance on forward-facing polygons is enabled; FALSE indicates that it is disabled. 

### -field BackEnable

A Boolean value that specifies whether the performance of stencil operations on back-facing polygons is enabled. TRUE indicates that the performance on back-facing polygons is enabled; FALSE indicates that it is disabled. 

### -field StencilReadMask

An 8-bit bitwise value that the driver uses in a bitwise AND operation with the stencil value in the stencil buffer immediately after reading the stencil value out of the stencil buffer.

### -field StencilWriteMask

An 8-bit bitwise value that the driver uses in a bitwise AND operation with the current stencil value before writing the result back out to the stencil buffer.

### -field FrontFace

A [D3D12DDI_DEPTH_STENCILOP_DESC](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_depth_stencilop_desc.md) structure that describes the stencil operation to perform on forward-facing polygons.

### -field BackFace
 
A [D3D12DDI_DEPTH_STENCILOP_DESC](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_depth_stencilop_desc.md) structure that describes the stencil operation to perform on back-facing polygons.
 
### -field LibraryReference

A [D3D12DDI_LIBRARY_REFERENCE_0010](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_library_reference_0010.md) structure that describes the library.

### -field DepthBoundsTestEnable
 
TRUE to enable depth-bounds testing; otherwise, FALSE. The default value is FALSE.

## -remarks

If the StencilEnable member is set to TRUE, the FrontEnable member, BackEnable member, or both must also be set to TRUE.

## -see-also
