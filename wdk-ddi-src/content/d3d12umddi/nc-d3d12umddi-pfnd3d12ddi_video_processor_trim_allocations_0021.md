# PFND3D12DDI_VIDEO_PROCESSOR_TRIM_ALLOCATIONS_0021 callback function


## -description


The <i>pfnProcessorTrimAllocations</i> callback function  trims allocations for submissions that are finished.


## -parameters




### -param hdrvDevice


### -param hDrvVideoProcessor

The video processor for which to submit this frame.


### -param SubmissionID

The submission ID is a monotonically increasing integer value.  The value passed to this method indicates that the submission ID and all earlier values are now complete and the driver may free or re-use resources associated with this ID.


## -remarks



Applications track command completion.  To allow driver to manage memory, an application calls this method with a <i>SubmissionID</i> parameter to indicate which submissions are complete.
