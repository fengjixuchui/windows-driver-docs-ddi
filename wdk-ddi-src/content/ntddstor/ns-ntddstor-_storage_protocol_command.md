# _STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND structure

## -description

This structure is used with the [IOCTL_STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_protocol_command) pass-through mechanism that issues a vendor-specific protocol command to a storage device.

## -struct-fields

### -field Version

The version of this structure. Set this to be **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STRUCTURE_VERSION**.

### -field Length

The size of this structure. Set this to sizeof(**STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND**).

### -field ProtocolType

The protocol type.

### -field Flags

Flags set for this request. The following are valid flags.

| Flag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND_FLAG_ADAPTER_REQUEST** | This flag indicates the request to target an adapter instead of device. |

### -field ReturnStatus

The status of the request made to the storage device. In Windows 10, possible values that can be returned include:

| Status value | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_PENDING**                | The request is pending. |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_SUCCESS**                | The request has completed successfully. |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_ERROR**                  | The request has encountered an error. |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_INVALID_REQUEST**        | The request is not valid. |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_NO_DEVICE**              | A device is not available to make a request to. |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_BUSY**                   | The device is busy acting on the request. |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_DATA_OVERRUN**           | The device encountered a data overrun while acting on the request. |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES** | The device cannot complete the request due to insufficient resources. |
| **STORAGE_PROTOCOL_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED**          | The request is not supported. |

### -field ErrorCode

The bus-specific protocol error code to return for this request. This is optionally set.

### -field CommandLength

The length of the command, in bytes. The caller must set this to a non-zero value.

### -field ErrorInfoLength

The length of the **ErrorCode** buffer, in bytes. This is optionally set and can be set to 0.

### -field DataToDeviceTransferLength

The size of the buffer that is to be transferred to the device.

### -field DataFromDeviceTransferLength

The size of the buffer this is to be transferred from the device.

### -field TimeOutValue

Specifies how long to wait for the device until timing out. This is set in units of seconds.

### -field ErrorInfoOffset

The offset of the **ErrorCode** buffer. This must be pointer-aligned.

### -field DataToDeviceBufferOffset

The offset of the buffer that is to be transferred to the device. This must be pointer-aligned and is only used with a WRITE request.

### -field DataFromDeviceBufferOffset

The offset of the buffer that is to be transferred from the device. This must be pointer-aligned and is only used with a READ request.

### -field CommandSpecific

Additional command-specific data passed along with **Command**. This depends on the command from the driver, and is optionally set.

### -field Reserved0

Reserved for future use.

### -field FixedProtocolReturnData

The return data. This is optionally set. Some protocols such as NVMe, may return a small amount of data (DWORD0 from completion queue entry) without the need of a separate device data transfer.

### -field Reserved1

Reserved for future use.

### -field Command

The vendor-specific command that is to be passed-through to the device.
