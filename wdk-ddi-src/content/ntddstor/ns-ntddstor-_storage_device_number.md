# _STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER structure


## -description


The STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_get_device_number">IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER</a> request to retrieve the FILE_DEVICE_<i>XXX</i> device type, the device number, and, for a device that can be partitioned, the partition number assigned to a device by the driver when the device is started. 


## -struct-fields




### -field DeviceType

Specifies one of the system-defined FILE_DEVICE_<i>XXX</i> constants indicating the type of device (such as FILE_DEVICE_DISK, FILE_DEVICE_KEYBOARD, and so forth) or a vendor-defined value for a new type of device. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/specifying-device-types">Specifying Device Types</a>. 


### -field DeviceNumber

Indicates the number of this device. This value is set to 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) for the disks that represent the physical paths of an MPIO disk.


### -field PartitionNumber

Indicates the partition number of the device is returned in this member, if the device can be partitioned. Otherwise, -1 is returned. 


## -remarks



The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_get_device_number">IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER</a> request is usually issued by a fault-tolerant disk driver.

The values in the STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER structure are guaranteed to remain unchanged until the system is rebooted. They are not guaranteed to be persistent across boots.
