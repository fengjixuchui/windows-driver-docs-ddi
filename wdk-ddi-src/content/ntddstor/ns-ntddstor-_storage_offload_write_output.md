# _STORAGE_OFFLOAD_WRITE_OUTPUT structure


## -description

The STORAGE_OFFLOAD_WRITE_OUTPUT structure is the output of an [IOCTL_STORAGE_MANAGE_DATA_SET_ATTRIBUTES](./ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_manage_data_set_attributes.md) control code request when the **Action** member of [DEVICE_DSM_INPUT](./ns-ntddstor-_device_manage_data_set_attributes.md) is set to **DeviceDsmAction_OffloadWrite**.

## -struct-fields

### -field OffloadWriteFlags

Flags indicating the result of the offload write operation. This is set to one of the following.

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| STORAGE_OFFLOAD_WRITE_RANGE_TRUNCATED | The offload write was performed but the range written was truncated. |
| STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN_INVALID | The token provided for the offload write operation was invalid. |

### -field Reserved

Reserved.

### -field LengthCopied

Bytes copied for the write request in DEVICE_DSM_OFFLOAD_WRITE_PARAMETERS.

## -remarks

On input, a token value in [DEVICE_DSM_OFFLOAD_WRITE_PARAMETERS](./ns-ntddstor-_device_dsm_offload_write_parameters.md) uniquely identifies the data set ranges requested for writing in the DEVICE_DSM_INPUT structure. The STORAGE_OFFLOAD_WRITE_OUTPUT structure contains the results of the write operation.

The STORAGE_OFFLOAD_WRITE_OUTPUT structure is returned at the beginning of the system buffer.
