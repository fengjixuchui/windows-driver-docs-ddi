# IOCTL_STORAGE_SET_HOTPLUG_INFO IOCTL


## -description



Sets the hotplug configuration of the specified device. This request takes a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-_storage_hotplug_info">STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO</a> structure as input. The <b>DeviceHotplug</b> member of the STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO structure determines what action is taken. If the value of that member is nonzero, the value for the device's removal policy in the registry is set to <b>ExpectSurpriseRemoval</b> and all levels of caching are disabled. If the value of <b>DeviceHotplug</b> is zero, the removal policy is set to <b>ExpectOrderlyRemoval</b>, and caching might be selectively enabled. 




## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The input buffer.


### -input-buffer-length

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location indicates the size, in bytes, of the parameter buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO). 


### -output-buffer

The driver returns the hotplug configuration data in a STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO structure in the buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>. 


### -output-buffer-length

The length of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-_storage_hotplug_info">STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO</a> structure.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

The <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS, or possibly to STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH if the input buffer is too small. It is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_1 if the <b>Size</b> member of STORAGE_HOTPLUG_INFO is not the size expected by the class driver for this device. It is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_2 if the <b>MediaRemoveable</b> member has a value different from that held by the class driver. It is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_3 if the <b>MediaHotplug</b> member has a value different from that held by the class driver, and it is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_5 if the <b>WriteCacheEnableOverride</b> member has a value different from that held by the class driver.
