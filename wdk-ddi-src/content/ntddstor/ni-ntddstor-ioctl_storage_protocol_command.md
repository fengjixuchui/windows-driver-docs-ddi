# IOCTL_STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND IOCTL


## -description


A driver can use <b>IOCTL_STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND</b> to pass vendor-specific commands to a storage device.


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

None.


### -input-buffer-length

None.


### -output-buffer

The driver returns the results of the vendor-specific command to the buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>. Cast the structure returned to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-_storage_protocol_command">STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND</a> and check its <b>ReturnStatus</b> field to determine the status of the command request.


### -output-buffer-length

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location indicates the size, in bytes, of the parameter buffer, which must be >= <b>sizeof</b>(<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-_storage_protocol_command">STORAGE_PROTOCOL_COMMAND</a>). 


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

The <b>Information</b> field is set to the number of bytes returned. The <b>Status</b> field is set to <b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b>, or possibly to <b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b>.
