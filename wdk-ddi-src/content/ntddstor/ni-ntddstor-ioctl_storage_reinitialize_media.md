# IOCTL_STORAGE_REINITIALIZE_MEDIA IOCTL


## -description

A driver can use the **IOCTL_STORAGE_REINITIALIZE_MEDIA** control code to reinitialize/erase a device. The IOCTL offloads the erasure to the storage device; there is no guarantee as to the successful deletion or recoverability of the data of the storage device after the command completes.  This IOCTL is limited to data disks on devices in the desktop device family. In Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE), this IOCTL is supported for both boot and data disks.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

None.

### -input-buffer-length

None.

### -output-buffer

None.

### -output-buffer-length

None.

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

The **Information** field is set to zero if the operation completes successfully; otherwise, it is set to a non-zero value.

## -remarks

Initial implementation requires no input and returns no output other than status. Callers should first call [FSCTL_LOCK_VOLUME](/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-fsctl_lock_volume) before calling this ioctl to flush out cached data in upper layers. No waiting of outstanding request completion is done before issuing the command to the device.
