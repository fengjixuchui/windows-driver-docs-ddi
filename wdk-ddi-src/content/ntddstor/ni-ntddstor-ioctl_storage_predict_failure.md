# IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE IOCTL


## -description

Polls for a prediction of device failure. This request works with the IDE disk drives that support self-monitoring analysis and reporting technology (SMART). If the drive is a SCSI drive, the class driver attempts to verify if the SCSI disk supports the equivalent IDE SMART technology by check the inquiry information on the Information Exception Control Page, X3T10/94-190 Rev 4. 

If the device supports prediction failure, the disk class driver queries the device for failure prediction status and reports the results. If the disk class driver assigns a nonzero value to the <b>PredictFailure</b> member of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-_storage_predict_failure">STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE</a> in the output buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>, the disk has bad sectors and is predicting a failure. The storage stack returns 512 bytes of vendor-specific information about the failure prediction in the <b>VendorSpecific</b> member of STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE. 

If the <b>PredictFailure</b> member contains a value of zero, the disk is not predicting a failure.

If the device does not support failure prediction, IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE fails with a status of STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST, and the data in the output buffer is undefined

Other means of checking for disk failure include monitoring the event log and registering to receive a WMI event with WMI_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE_EVENT_GUID.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

None.

### -input-buffer-length

None.

### -output-buffer

The driver returns a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-_storage_predict_failure">STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE</a> structure containing failure prediction data in the buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.

### -output-buffer-length

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength</b> indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer,</b> which must be greater or equal to the <b>sizeof</b>(STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE).

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

<b>Irp->IoStatus.Status</b> is set to STATUS_SUCCESS if the request is successful. Otherwise, <b>Status</b> to the appropriate error condition as a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values">NTSTATUS</a> code.
