# _STORAGE_ADAPTER_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>STORAGE_ADAPTER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> request to retrieve the storage adapter descriptor data for a device. 


## -struct-fields




### -field Version

Contains the version of the structure <b>STORAGE_ADAPTER_DESCRIPTOR</b>. The value of this member will change as members are added to the structure.


### -field Size

Specifies the total size of the descriptor, in bytes.


### -field MaximumTransferLength

Specifies the maximum number of bytes the host bus adapter (HBA) can transfer in a single operation.


### -field MaximumPhysicalPages

Specifies the maximum number of discontinuous physical pages the HBA can manage in a single transfer (in other words, the extent of its scatter/gather support).


### -field AlignmentMask

Specifies the HBA's alignment requirements for transfers. A storage class driver sets the <b>AlignmentRequirement</b> field in its device objects to this value. The alignment mask indicates alignment restrictions for buffers required by the HBA for transfer operations. The valid mask values are 0 (byte aligned), 1 (word aligned), 3 (DWORD aligned), and 7 (double DWORD aligned). 


### -field AdapterUsesPio

Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the HBA uses Programmed Input/Output (PIO) and requires the use of system-space virtual addresses mapped to physical memory for data buffers. When <b>FALSE</b>, the HBA does not use PIO.


### -field AdapterScansDown

Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the HBA scans down for BIOS devices, that is, the HBA begins scanning with the highest device number rather than the lowest. When <b>FALSE</b>, the HBA begins scanning with the lowest device number. This member is reserved for legacy miniport drivers.


### -field CommandQueueing

Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the HBA supports SCSI-tagged queuing and/or per-logical-unit internal queues, or the non-SCSI equivalent. When <b>FALSE</b>, the HBA neither supports SCSI-tagged queuing nor per-logical-unit internal queues. 


### -field AcceleratedTransfer

Indicates when <b>TRUE</b> that the HBA supports synchronous transfers as a way of speeding up I/O. When <b>FALSE</b>, the HBA does not support synchronous transfers as a way of speeding up I/O. 


### -field BusType

Specifies a value of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff566356(v=vs.85)">STORAGE_BUS_TYPE</a> that indicates the type of bus to which the device is connected.


### -field BusMajorVersion

Specifies the major version number, if any, of the HBA. 


### -field BusMinorVersion

Specifies the minor version number, if any, of the HBA.


### -field SrbType

Specifies the SCSI request block (SRB) type used by the HBA.

This member is valid starting with Windows 8.


### -field AddressType

Specifies the address type of the HBA.

<td width="60%">
The HBA uses 8-bit bus, target, and LUN addressing.

This member is valid starting with Windows 8.


## -remarks



Storage class drivers issue a device-control request with the I/O control code <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property">IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</a> to retrieve this structure, which contains configuration information from the HBA for data transfer operations. The structure can be retrieved either from the device object for the bus or from a functional device object (FDO), which forwards the request to the underlying bus.

If excessive protocol errors occur on an HBA that supports synchronous transfers (<b>AcceleratedTransfer</b> is <b>TRUE</b>), the storage class driver can disable synchronous transfers by setting SRB_FLAGS_DISABLE_SYNCH_TRANSFER in SRBs.
