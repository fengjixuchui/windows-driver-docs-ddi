# STORAGE_HW_ENDURANCE_INFO structure

## -description

A storage port driver uses the STORAGE_HW_ENDURANCE_INFO structure to report a device's endurance information.

## -struct-fields

### -field ValidFields

Bitmask that indicates which of the remaining members contain valid data. Can be any of the combination of the following bits:

| Bit | Meaning |
| 0 | The *GroupId* member contains valid data. |
| 1 | The *Flags* member contains valid data. |
| 2 | The *LifePercentage* member contains valid data. |
| 3 | The *BytesReadCount* member contains valid data. |
| 4 | Th  *ByteWriteCount* member contains valid data. |

### -field GroupId

ID number that represents a group of resources.

### -field Flags

### -field Flags.Shared

Set TRUE if the endurance information is shared with multiple disks.

### -field Flags.Reserved

Reserved; do not use.

### -field LifePercentage

Percentage of used life. This value is typically between 0-100, where a larger number indicates more life has been used.

### -field BytesReadCount

Total bytes read from the device, specified in billions. For example, a value of 1 would mean 1 billion bytes read.

### -field ByteWriteCount

Total bytes written to the device, specified in billions. For example, a value of 1 would mean 1 billion bytes written.

## -remarks

This structure is a member of [STORAGE_HW_ENDURANCE_DATA_DESCRIPTOR](ns-ntddstor-storage_hw_endurance_data_descriptor.md), which is the structure returned within the output buffer of an [IOCTL_SCSI_MINIPORT](../ntddscsi/ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_scsi_miniport.md) request.
