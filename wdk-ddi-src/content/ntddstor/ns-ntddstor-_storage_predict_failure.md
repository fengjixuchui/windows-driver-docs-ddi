# _STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE structure


## -description


The STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE structure is used in conjunction with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_predict_failure">IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE</a> to report whether a device is currently predicting a failure.


## -struct-fields




### -field PredictFailure

Indicates when nonzero that the device is currently predicting an imminent failure.


### -field VendorSpecific

Contains an array that holds 512 bytes of vendor-specific information if the device supports failure prediction. 


## -remarks



Upon receiving an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_predict_failure">IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE</a> device control request, the disk class driver attempts to verify if an IDE drive supports SMART. If the drive is a SCSI drive, the class driver attempts to verify if the SCSI disk supports the equivalent IDE SMART technology: Information Exception Control Page, X3T10/94-190 Rev 4. 

If the device does not support failure prediction, the disk class driver fails the IRP with a status of STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST.

If the device supports failure prediction, the disk class driver queries the device for failure prediction status. If the device has bad sectors and predicts a failure, the disk class driver returns a nonzero value in <b>PredictFailure</b>. If status indicates that the device does not predict any failures at this time, the disk class driver returns a value of 0 in <b>PredictFailure</b>.
