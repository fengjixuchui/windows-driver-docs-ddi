# _STORAGE_HW_FIRMWARE_INFO structure


## -description


This structure contains information about the device firmware.


## -struct-fields




### -field Version

The version of this structure. This should be set to sizeof(STORAGE_HW_FIRMWARE_INFO)


### -field Size

The size of this structure as a buffer including slot.


### -field SupportUpgrade

Indicates that this firmware supports an upgrade.


### -field Reserved0

Reserved for future use.


### -field SlotCount

The number of firmware slots on the device. This is the dimension of the Slot array.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>   Some devices can store more than 1 firmware image, if they have more than 1 firmware slot.</div>
<div> </div>

### -field ActiveSlot

The firmware slot containing the currently active/running firmware image.


### -field PendingActivateSlot

The firmware slot that is pending activation.


### -field FirmwareShared

Indicates that the firmware applies to both the device and controller/adapter, e.g. NVMe SSD.




### -field Reserved

Reserved for future use.


### -field ImagePayloadAlignment

The alignment of the image payload, in number of bytes. The maximum is PAGE_SIZE. The transfer size is a mutliple of this size. Some protocols require at least sector size. When this value is set to 0, this means that this value is invalid.


### -field ImagePayloadMaxSize

The image payload maximum size, this is used for a single command.


### -field Slot

Contains the slot information for each slot on the device.
