# IOCTL_STORAGE_PERSISTENT_RESERVE_IN IOCTL


## -description


The generic storage class driver (<i>classpnp.sys</i>) exposes an I/O control (IOCTL) interface for issuing Persistent Reserve In commands. The behavior of the storage device when a Persistent Reserve In command is received is described in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=153142">SCSI Primary Commands - 2 (SPC-2)</a> specification. The IOCTL interface requires the caller to have read access to the physical device for Persistent Reserve In commands. User-mode applications, services, and kernel-mode drivers can use this IOCTL to control persistent reservations. If called from a driver, this IOCTL must be called from a thread running at IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL. This IOCTL is defined with FILE_READ_ACCESS, requiring a device handle to have read permissions to issue the Persistent Reserve In command.


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-_persistent_reserve_command">PERSISTENT_RESERVE_COMMAND</a> structure. You must allocate the buffer from nonpaged pool and must align it correctly for the  target device and adapter.

PR_IN.ServiceAction can be one of the following:

<ul>
<li>
RESERVATION_ACTION_READ_KEYS

</li>
<li>
RESERVATION_ACTION_READ_RESERVATIONS

</li>
</ul>
PR_IN.Allocation length is the size (in bytes) of the buffer allocated for the returned parameter list.


### -input-buffer-length

The length of .


### -output-buffer

For PR_IN.ServiceAction = RESERVATION_ACTION_READ_KEYS, the output buffer contains a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/scsi/ns-scsi-pri_registration_list">PRI_REGISTRATION_LIST</a> structure and must be at least sizeof(PRI_REGISTRATION_LIST).

For PR_IN.ServiceAction = RESERVATION_ACTION_READ_RESERVATIONS, the output buffer contains a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/minitape/ns-minitape-pri_reservation_list">PRI_RESERVATION_LIST</a> structure and must be at least sizeof(PRI_RESERVATION_LIST).

If the allocated buffer is too small to return all the Persistent Reserve In data, success will be returned and the required size will be returned in the parameter list <b>AdditionalLength</b> field.


### -output-buffer-length

The length of .


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

The <b>Information</b> field is set to the size of the output buffer. For ServiceAction = RESERVATION_ACTION_READ_KEYS, the output buffer is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/scsi/ns-scsi-pri_registration_list">PRI_REGISTRATION_LIST</a> structure. For ServiceAction = RESERVATION_ACTION_READ_RESERVATIONS, the output buffer is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/minitape/ns-minitape-pri_reservation_list">PRI_RESERVATION_LIST</a> structure.

The <b>Status</b> field is set to one of the following:




**STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW (ERROR_MORE_DATA)**

The output buffer is too small to hold the Persistent Reserve In data. The output buffer's <b>AdditionalLength</b> field will contain the size of the data to be returned.


**STATUS_DEVICE_BUSY (ERROR_BUSY)**

The command failed because of a Reservation Conflict (for more information, see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=153142">SCSI Primary Commands - 2 (SPC-2)</a> specification).


**STATUS_INFO_LENGTH_MISMATCH**

The input buffer length for the IOCTL is less than sizeof(PERSISTENT_RESERVE_COMMAND) or the size that is specified in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddstor/ns-ntddstor-_persistent_reserve_command">PERSISTENT_RESERVE_COMMAND</a> data structure is less than sizeof(PERSISTENT_RESERVE_COMMAND).


**STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST (ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION)**

The I/O control code (IOCTL_STORAGE_PERSISTENT_RESERVE_IN) is not supported by the storage drivers.


**STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER (ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER)**

The input buffer structure is incorrectly sized or populated.


**STATUS_INVALID_USER_BUFFER (ERROR_INVALID_USER_BUFFER)**

The input or output buffer is not aligned correctly for the device or adapter.  This status could only be returned when a driver sends an IOCTL to the storage stack.  This status will not be returned when a user-mode application sends the IOCTL through the DeviceIoControl API as the I/O Manager automatically aligns the buffers.


**STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR (ERROR_IO_DEVICE)**

The device does not support the Persistent Reserve In command.


**STATUS_SUCCESS**

The operation was successful.
