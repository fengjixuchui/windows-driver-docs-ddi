# _PEP_ACPI_QUERY_DEVICE_CONTROL_RESOURCES structure


## -description


The <b>PEP_ACPI_QUERY_DEVICE_CONTROL_RESOURCES</b> structure contains a list of raw  resources that are needed to control power to the device.


## -struct-fields




### -field DeviceHandle

[in] A PEPHANDLE value that identifies the device's registration for ACPI services. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) supplied this handle in response to a previous <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_acpi_register_device">PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.


### -field RequestFlags

[in] A set of input flags. No flags are currently defined for this member, which is always set to PEP_ACPI_QDCR_FLAG_NONE (0x0).


### -field Status

[out] An NTSTATUS value that indicates the status of this query. Set this member to STATUS_SUCCESS if the PEP succeeded in providing the requested list of resources. Set to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL to indicate that the output buffer is not large enough to contain the resource list.


### -field BiosResourcesSize

[in, out] On input, the size, in bytes, of the buffer allocated for the <b>BiosResources</b> member. This buffer size includes any associated data that might follow this member.

If this buffer is not large enough to contain the <b>ACPI_METHOD_ARGUMENT</b> structure and its associated data, the PEP overwrites the input value of <b>BiosResourcesSize</b> with the required size and sets the <b>Status</b> member to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL.


### -field BiosResources

[in] An output buffer to which the PEP writes an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/acpiioct/ns-acpiioct-_acpi_method_argument_v1">ACPI_METHOD_ARGUMENT</a> structure that contains the requested resource list. The <b>Data</b> member of this structure is the first member in an array that might extend past the end of the structure. The buffer size specified by <b>BiosResourcesSize</b> includes both the <b>ACPI_METHOD_ARGUMENT</b> structure and any <b>Data</b> array elements that follow this structure. For more information, see TBD.


## -remarks



This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_acpi_query_device_control_resources">PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_QUERY_DEVICE_CONTROL_RESOURCES</a> notification. The <b>RequestFlags</b>, <b>BiosResourcesSize</b>, and <b>BiosResources</b> members of the structure contain input values supplied by the Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/index">power management framework</a> (PoFx) when this notification is sent. If the <b>BiosResourcesSize</b> input value is too small, the PEP should overwrite this value. The <b>Status</b> member contains an output value that the PEP writes to this structure in response to the notification.

If the input value specified in the <b>BiosResourcesSize</b> member is less than the required size, the PEP overwrites the <b>BiosResourcesSize</b> input value with the required size, and sets the <b>Status</b> member to STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL. In response, PoFx will try to allocate a buffer of the required size and send a second <b>PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_QUERY_DEVICE_CONTROL_RESOURCES</b> notification to the PEP for this device.
