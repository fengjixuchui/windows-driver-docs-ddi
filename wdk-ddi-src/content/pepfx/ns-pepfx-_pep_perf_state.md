# _PEP_PERF_STATE structure


## -description


The <b>PEP_PERF_STATE</b> structure describes a performance state (P-state) in a P-state set in which the P-states are specified as a list of one or more discrete values.


## -struct-fields




### -field Value

The discrete value represented by this P-state. For more information, see Remarks.


### -field Context

A pointer to PEP-defined context data. The PEP uses this context to contain additional information about the discrete performance level that cannot be expressed in the <b>Value</b> member. This context is opaque to the Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/index">power management framework</a> (PoFx). The <b>Context</b> member is optional and can be set to NULL.


## -remarks



The <b>Discrete.States</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_component_perf_set">PEP_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</a> structure is a pointer to an array of <b>PEP_PERF_STATE</b> structures. The <b>Unit</b> member of the <b>PEP_COMPONENT_PERF_SET</b> structure specifies the units in which the <b>Value</b> member in each array element is expressed. Component performance can be expressed in hertz (frequency) or in bits per second (bandwidth). For example, if <b>Value</b> = 100,000,000 and <b>Unit</b> = <b>PepPerfStateUnitFrequency</b>, this performance state represents a frequency of 100 megahertz.

Device drivers use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_po_fx_perf_state">PO_FX_PERF_STATE</a> structure, which is similar to the <b>PEP_PERF_STATE</b> structure.
