## -description

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft supports a diverse and inclusionary environment.  Within this document, there are references to the word slave. Microsoft's [Style Guide for Bias-Free Communications](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/bias-free-communication) recognizes this as an exclusionary word.  This wording is used as it is currently the wording used within the software. When this word is removed from the software, we will correct this document to be in alignment.


The <b>PEP_ACPI_INITIALIZE_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE</b> function initializes a platform extension plug-in's (PEP) <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_acpi_spb_spi_resource">PEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE</a> structure.


## -parameters




### -param DeviceSelection [in]

The device selection value. This value is
specific to the device and may refer to a chip-select line, GPIO
line, or other line selection mechanism.


### -param DeviceSelectionPolarity [in]

The polarity of the clock. If zero, this indicates the
clock is low during the first phase. If 1, this indicates the
clock is high during the first phase.


### -param WireMode [in]

When zero, indicates that this device produces and consumes this resource. Otherwise, this device only consumes this resource.


### -param DataBitLength [in]

The size, in bits, of the smallest unit of transfer.


### -param SlaveMode [in]

Indicates if the resource is operating in slave mode.


### -param ConnectionSpeed [in]

The maximum speed, in hertz, supported by this connection.


### -param ClockPolarity [in]

The polarity of the clock. If zero, this indicates the
clock is low during the first phase. If 1, this indicates the
clock is high during the first phase.


### -param ClockPhase [in]

The phase of the clock pulse on which to capture data.


### -param ResourceSource [in]

The name of the serial bus controller device to which this
connection descriptor applies. The name can be a fully
qualified path, a relative path, or a simple name segment
that utilizes the namespace search rules.


### -param ResourceSourceIndex [in]

This parameter should always be set to zero.


### -param ResourceUsage [in]

Indicates if the resource is in use.


### -param SharedMode [in]

Indicates if the resource is shared.


### -param VendorData [in]

A pointer to optional data that is specific to the serial bus connection type.


### -param VendorDataLength [in]

The length of the buffer pointed to by the <i>VendorData</i> parameter.


### -param Resource [out]

A pointer to the resource. The structure behind the pointer is of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_acpi_spb_spi_resource">PEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE</a>.
