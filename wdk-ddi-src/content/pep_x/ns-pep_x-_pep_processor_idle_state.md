# _PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_STATE structure


## -description

The <b>PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_STATE</b> structure describes the capabilities of a processor idle state.

## -struct-fields

### -field Ulong

### -field Interruptible

### -field CacheCoherent

### -field ThreadContextRetained

### -field CStateType

### -field Reserved

 




#### - ( unnamed union )

A collection of flag bits and status fields that can be accessed either individually as bitfields, or together as a 32-bit unsigned integer value.



#### Ulong

Flag bits and status fields accessed as a single 32-bit unsigned integer value.



#### ( unnamed struct )

Flag bits and status fields accessed as individual bitfields.



##### Interruptible

Whether the processor can respond to interrupts when in this idle state. Set this flag bit to 1 if the processor can respond to interrupts, and to 0 if it cannot.



##### CacheCoherent

Whether the processor's local cache or caches remain coherent through the duration of this processor idle state. Set this flag bit to 1 if cache coherency is maintained in this idle state, and to 0 if it is not.



##### ThreadContextRetained

Whether thread context is retained in this processor idle state. Set this flag bit to 1 if the processor hardware retains the thread context across the idle transition. Set to 0 if the processor uses the multiprocessor parking protocol to exit the idle state and return control to the operating system. For more information about this protocol, see the document titled "Multiprocessor Startup for ARM Platforms" at <a href="https://www.acpica.org/related-documents">https://www.acpica.org/related-documents</a>.



##### CStateType

The C-state type of the processor idle state. Set this bitfield to zero if this idle state does not correspond to an ACPI-defined C-state. Otherwise, set this bitfield to the C-state number. That is, set <b>CStateType</b> = 1 for C1, set <b>CStateType</b> = 2 for C2, and so on. For more information about C-states, see section 8.1, "Processor Power States", of the [ACPI 5.0 specification](https://uefi.org/specifications).



##### Reserved

Reserved for future use.

## -remarks

The <b>IdleStates</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pep_x/ns-pep_x-_pep_ppm_query_idle_states">PEP_PPM_QUERY_IDLE_STATES</a> structure is the first element in an array of <b>PEP_PROCESSOR_IDLE_STATE</b> structures.
