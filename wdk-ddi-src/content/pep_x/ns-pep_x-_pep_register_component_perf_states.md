# _PEP_REGISTER_COMPONENT_PERF_STATES structure


## -description


The <b>PEP_REGISTER_COMPONENT_PERF_STATES</b> structure describes the performance states (P-states) of the specified component.


## -struct-fields




### -field DeviceHandle

[in] A PEPHANDLE value that identifies the device. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) supplied this handle in response to a previous <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_register_crashdump_device">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.


### -field Component

[in] The index that identifies the component. This member is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_device_register_v2">PEP_DEVICE_REGISTER_V2</a> structure that the PEP previously supplied in response to the <b>PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</b> notification for this device. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.


### -field Flags

[in] A set of input flags. No flag bits are currently defined for this member, which is always zero.


### -field PerfStateInfo

[in] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_component_perf_info">PEP_COMPONENT_PERF_INFO</a> structure that contains the performance information for this component's P-states. If this member is non-NULL, it points to P-state information that was supplied by the device driver.


## -remarks



This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_register_component_perf_states">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_COMPONENT_PERF_STATES</a> notification. The values of all members of the <b>PEP_REGISTER_COMPONENT_PERF_STATES</b> structure  are supplied by the Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/index">power management framework</a> (PoFx) when the notification is sent. The PEP must not write to this structure.

If the <b>PerfStateInfo</b> member is not NULL, the device driver has provided P-state information and requires the PEP to use it.
