# _PEP_ACPI_TRANSLATED_DEVICE_CONTROL_RESOURCES structure


## -description


The <b>PEP_ACPI_TRANSLATED_DEVICE_CONTROL_RESOURCES</b> structure contains a list of translated power-control resources for the platform extension plug-in (PEP) to use.


## -struct-fields




### -field DeviceHandle

[in] A PEPHANDLE value that identifies the device's registration for ACPI services. The platform extension plug-in (PEP) supplied this handle in response to a previous <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_acpi_register_device">PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.


### -field RequestFlags

[in] A set of input flags. No flags are currently defined for this member, which is always set to PEP_ACPI_TDCR_FLAG_NONE (0x0).


### -field Status

[out] An NTSTATUS value that indicates the status of the resource translation. The PEP sets this member to STATUS_SUCCESS to indicate that the PEP successfully received the translated resources. Otherwise, the PEP sets this member to an appropriate error status code.


### -field TranslatedResourcesSize

 


### -field TranslatedResources

[in] A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_cm_resource_list">CM_RESOURCE_LIST</a> structure that serves as the header for the resource list. The remainder of the resource list immediately follows this header.


#### - ResourceBufferSize

[in] The size in bytes of the input buffer that contains both this structure and the resource-list data that follows this structure.


## -remarks



This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_acpi_translated_device_control_resources">PEP_NOTIFY_ACPI_TRANSLATED_DEVICE_CONTROL_RESOURCES</a> notification to provide the PEP with a list of translated power control resources. The <b>RequestFlags</b>, <b>ResourceBufferSize</b>, and <b>TranslatedResources</b> members of the structure contain input values that the Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/index">power management framework</a> (PoFx) supplies when this notification is sent. The <b>Status</b> member contains an output value that the PEP writes to the structure in response to the notification.
