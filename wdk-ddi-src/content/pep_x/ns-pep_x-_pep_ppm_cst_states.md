# _PEP_PPM_CST_STATES structure


## -description


The <b>PEP_PPM_CST_STATES</b> structure specifies the properties of the C states (ACPI processor power states) that are supported for a processor.


## -struct-fields




### -field Count

The number of elements in the <b>IdleStates</b> array.


### -field IdleStates

A pointer to an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_ppm_cst_state">PEP_PPM_CST_STATE</a> structures.


## -remarks



This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_ppm_cst_states">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_CST_STATES</a> notification. The contents of this structure are obtained from the _CST object that is located in the ACPI namespace for the processor.
