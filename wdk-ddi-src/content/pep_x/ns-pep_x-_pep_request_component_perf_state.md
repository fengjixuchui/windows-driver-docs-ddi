# _PEP_REQUEST_COMPONENT_PERF_STATE structure


## -description


The <b>PEP_REQUEST_COMPONENT_PERF_STATE</b> structure contains a list of performance state (P-state) changes requested by the Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index">power management framework</a> (PoFx), plus status information about the handling of these requests by the platform extension plug-in (PEP).


## -struct-fields




### -field DeviceHandle

[in] A PEPHANDLE value that identifies the device. The PEP supplied this handle in response to a previous <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_register_crashdump_device">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification.


### -field Component

[in] The index that identifies the component. This member is an index into the <b>Components</b> array in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_device_register_v2">PEP_DEVICE_REGISTER_V2</a> structure that the PEP previously supplied in response to the <b>PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</b> notification for this device. If the <b>Components</b> array contains N elements, component indexes range from 0 to N–1.


### -field Completed

[out] Whether the PEP has completed the requested P-state changes. Set to TRUE to indicate that the P-state changes completed synchronously. Set to FALSE to indicate that the requested P-state changes are pending and will be completed asynchronously by a PEP worker thread. For more information, see Remarks.


### -field Succeeded

[out] Whether the requested P-state changes successfully completed. Set to TRUE if the PEP successfully completed all P-state changes requested in the <b>PerfRequests</b> array. Set to FALSE if the PEP was unable to perform all the requested P-state changes, in which case the P-states in the hardware were left unchanged. The <b>Succeeded</b> member is used only for <i>synchronous</i> P-state changes. If the PEP sets <b>Completed</b> to FALSE, PoFx ignores the value in the <b>Succeeded</b> member.


### -field PerfRequestsCount

[in] The number of P-state changes requested in the array pointed to by the <b>PerfRequests</b> member.


### -field PerfRequests

[in] A pointer to an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_component_perf_state_request">PEP_COMPONENT_PERF_STATE_REQUEST</a> structures. Each element in the array specifies a new performance level to assign to a P-state set. The number of array elements is specified by the <b>PerfRequestsCount</b> member.


## -remarks



This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_request_component_perf_state">PEP_DPM_REQUEST_COMPONENT_PERF_STATE</a> notification. The <b>DeviceHandle</b>, <b>Component</b>, <b>PerfRequestsCount</b>, and <b>PerfRequests</b> members of the structure contain input values that are supplied by PoFx when this notification is sent. The <b>Completed</b> and <b>Succeeded</b> members contain output values that the PEP writes to the structure in response to the notification.

The PEP can complete the requested P-state changes either synchronously or asynchronously. The PEP can set the <b>Completed</b> member to TRUE to indicate that all the requests in the <b>PEP_DPM_REQUEST_COMPONENT_PERF_STATE</b> notification have been completed synchronously—that is, before the return from the PEP's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/nc-pepfx-pepcallbacknotifydpm">AcceptDeviceNotification</a> callback routine. Or, the PEP can set <b>Completed</b> to FALSE to indicate that the requests will be completed asynchronously. To complete the requests asynchronously, the PEP should call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/nc-pepfx-pofxcallbackrequestworker">RequestWorker</a> routine to inform PoFx that the PEP has a work request to submit, and PoFx will respond by sending a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-peps-for-acpi-services">PEP_DPM_WORK</a> notification to the PEP.

PoFx writes the requested P-state changes to the <b>PerfRequests</b> array before the <b>PEP_DPM_REQUEST_COMPONENT_PERF_STATE</b> notification is sent. If the PEP handles the requested P-state changes <i>synchronously</i>, the contents of the <b>PerfRequests</b> array remain valid only until the return from the <i>AcceptDeviceNotification</i> callback routine. If the requests are completed <i>asynchronously</i>,  the array contents remain valid until the PEP calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt186629">CompleteWork</a> routine to notify PoFx that the PEP has completed the pending requests.
