# _PEP_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES structure


## -description


The <b>PEP_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</b> structure contains information about the processor power management (PPM) capabilities of the platform extension plug-in (PEP).


## -struct-fields




### -field FeedbackCounterCount

[out] The number of processor performance feedback counters supported by the PEP for this processor. On x86/AMD64 platforms, this must be zero.


### -field IdleStateCount

[out] The number of processor idle states that the PEP supports. The PEP is not required to support the same number of idle states for all processors. The PEP can set <b>IdleStateCount</b> = 0 to indicate that it doesn't support any idle states, in which case the PEP doesn't need to implement any other notifications that deal with processor idle states.


### -field PerformanceStatesSupported

[out] Whether the PEP supports performance state controls. Set to TRUE if the PEP supports performance states, or to FALSE if it does not.


### -field ParkingSupported

[out] Whether the PEP supports supplying core parking hints. Set to TRUE if the PEP can indicate which cores to park, or to FALSE if it cannot.


### -field DiscretePerformanceStateCount

 




## -remarks



This structure is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_ppm_query_capabilities">PEP_NOTIFY_PPM_QUERY_CAPABILITIES</a> notification. All four members contain output values that the PEP writes to the structure in response to this notification.
