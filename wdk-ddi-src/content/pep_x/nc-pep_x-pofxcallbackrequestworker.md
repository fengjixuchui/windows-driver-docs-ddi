# POFXCALLBACKREQUESTWORKER callback function


## -description


The <b>RequestWorker</b> routine is called by a platform extension plug-in (PEP) to inform the Windows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index">power management framework</a> (PoFx) that the platform extension plug-in (PEP) has a work request to submit on behalf of the specified device.


## -parameters




### -param PluginHandle [in]

A POHANDLE value that represents the registration of the device with PoFx. The PEP previously received this handle from PoFx during the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_register_crashdump_device">PEP_DPM_REGISTER_DEVICE</a> notification that informed the PEP that the device's driver stack registered the device with PoFx.


## -remarks



This routine is implemented by PoFx and is called by the PEP. The <b>RequestWorker</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pepfx/ns-pepfx-_pep_kernel_information_struct_v3">PEP_KERNEL_INFORMATION_STRUCT_V3</a> structure is a pointer to a <b>RequestWorker</b> routine.

Each time the PEP calls this routine, PoFx responds by sending a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-peps-for-acpi-services">PEP_DPM_WORK</a> notification to the PEP. This notification might be delayed if a worker thread is not immediately available to process the work request.

A PEP can call this routine at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL.
