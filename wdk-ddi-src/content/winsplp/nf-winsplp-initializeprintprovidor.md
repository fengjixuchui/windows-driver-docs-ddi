# InitializePrintProvidor function


## -description


<div class="alert"><b>Warning</b>  <p class="note">Starting with Windows 10, the APIs which support third-party print providers are deprecated. Microsoft does not recommend any investment into third-party print providers. Additionally, on Windows 8 and newer products where the v4 print driver model is available, third-party print providers may not create or manage queues which use v4 print drivers.

</div><div> </div>A print provider's <b>InitializePrintProvidor</b> function initializes the provider and supplies the print spooler with the provider's entry points.


## -parameters




### -param pPrintProvidor [out]

Caller-supplied address of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winsplp/ns-winsplp-_printprovidor">PRINTPROVIDOR</a> structure, to be filled in by the print provider.


### -param cbPrintProvidor [in]

Caller-supplied size, in bytes, of the PRINTPROVIDOR structure pointed to by <i>pPrintProvidor</i>.


### -param pFullRegistryPath [in, optional]

Caller-supplied pointer to a string representing the full registry path to the provider's registry entry.


## -returns



If the operation succeeds, the function should return <b>TRUE</b>. Otherwise the function should return <b>FALSE</b>.




## -remarks



Print providers are required to define an <b>InitializePrintProvidor</b> function, which is the first function called by the spooler after the provider has been loaded. The function must fill the supplied <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winsplp/ns-winsplp-_printprovidor">PRINTPROVIDOR</a> structure with pointers to the provider's defined functions (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/print/functions-defined-by-print-providers">Functions Defined by Print Providers</a>). The function can also perform other provider-specific initialization operations.
