# GetPrintProcessorCapabilities function


## -description


A print processor's <b>GetPrintProcessorCapabilities</b> function returns capabilities associated with a specified input data type.


## -parameters




### -param pValueName [in]

Caller-supplied pointer to a string that represents a data type that is supported by the print processor. The string pointer must be of type LPWSTR.


### -param dwAttributes [in]

Caller-supplied attributes flags. Refer to the <b>Attributes</b> member of PRINTER_INFO_<i>x</i> structures (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).


### -param pData [out]

Caller-supplied pointer to a PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_1 or PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_2 structure (described in the Windows SDK documentation).


### -param nSize [in]

Caller-supplied value that represents the size of the buffer pointed to by <i>pData</i>.

If the value is less than sizeof(PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_1), this function should supply a value that is equal to sizeof(PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_1) or sizeof(PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_2), depending on which structure is supported by the print processor.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    If the value is less than sizeof(PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_1), the winprint print processor will supply a value of sizeof(PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_2) for Windows Vista operating systems, or sizeof(PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_1) for earlier operating system versions.</div>
<div> </div>

### -param pcbNeeded [out]

Caller-supplied pointer to a location to receive the minimum required size for the buffer pointed to by <i>pData</i>.


## -returns



If the operation succeeds, the function should return ERROR_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it should return a Win32 error code.




## -remarks



Print processors can optionally export a <b>GetPrintProcessorCapabilities</b> function. The function's purpose is to return a filled-in PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_1 or PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_2 structure for every input data type that the print processor supports.

The spooler calls a print processor's <b>GetPrintProcessorCapabilities</b> function when an application calls <b>GetPrinterData</b> (described in the Windows SDK documentation), specifying a value name with a format of PrintProcCaps_<i>datatype</i>, where <i>datatype</i> is the name of an input data type. Before calling <b>GetPrintProcessorCapabilities,</b> the spooler removes the PrintProcCaps_ prefix from the value name string.

The function should determine if the received buffer is large enough and, if it is, should fill in either the PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_1 or PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_2 structure (defined in the Windows SDK documentation) and return. The value of <i>nSize</i> determines whether PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_1 or PRINTPROCESSOR_CAPS_2 will be used.

The function should always use the location pointed to by <i>pcbNeeded</i> to return the required buffer size, whether or not the actual buffer is large enough.

The specified return value becomes the return value that the spooler provides for <b>GetPrinterData</b>.
