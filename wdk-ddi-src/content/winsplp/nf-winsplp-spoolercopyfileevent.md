# SpoolerCopyFileEvent function


## -description

A Point and Print DLL's <code>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</code> function receives notifications of events associated with copying print queue-associated files to a print client, when the client connects to a print server.

## -parameters

### -param pszPrinterName 

[in]
Caller-supplied pointer to a string representing the printer name.

### -param pszKey 

[in]
Caller-supplied pointer to a string representing a subkey under the printer's <b>CopyFiles</b> registry key. This subkey identifies the component to which the Point and Print DLL belongs.

### -param dwCopyFileEvent 

[in]
Caller-supplied flag that identifies the event being reported. Valid flag values are contained in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>When Received</th>
<th>Where Received</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
COPYFILE_EVENT_ADD_PRINTER_CONNECTION

</td>
<td>
After a client application has called <b>AddPrinterConnection</b>.

</td>
<td>
Client copy of <code>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</code>. The calling context is the client application.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
COPYFILE_EVENT_DELETE_PRINTER

</td>
<td>
After a call to <b>DeletePrinter</b> has been made.

</td>
<td>
Client copy of <code>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</code>. The calling context is the client's spooler.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
COPYFILE_EVENT_DELETE_PRINTER_CONNECTION

</td>
<td>
After a client application has called <b>DeletePrinterConnection</b>.

</td>
<td>
Client copy of <code>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</code>. The calling context is the client application.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
COPYFILE_EVENT_FILES_CHANGED

</td>
<td>
After the client has downloaded the files specified under the <b>pszKey</b> subkey of the printer's <b>CopyFiles</b> registry key.

</td>
<td>
Client copy of <code>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</code>. The calling context is the client's spooler.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
COPYFILE_EVENT_SET_PRINTER_DATAEX

</td>
<td>
After a call to <b>SetPrinterDataEx</b> has been processed on the server.

</td>
<td>
Server copy of <code>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</code>. The calling context is the client application, by impersonation.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -returns

If the function encounters errors, the function should return <b>FALSE</b>. Otherwise, it should return <b>TRUE</b>.

## -remarks

All <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/print/point-and-print-dlls">Point and Print DLLs</a> must export a <code>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</code> function, which is called by the print spooler. Its purpose is to allow a Point and Print DLL to be notified of events related to the downloading of print queue-associated files, from a print server to a client system, when an application on the client connects to the server. For a complete description of the steps involved in creating a Point and Print connection, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/print/supporting-point-and-print">Supporting Point and Print</a>.

A Point and Print DLL executes on both the server and the client. The <code>SpoolerCopyFileEvent</code> function can determine where it is executing by reading the contents of <i>dwCopyFileEvent</i>, which supplies a flag indicating the event. The function should process the event and return. If no processing is necessary, the function should just return <b>TRUE</b>.

If <i>dwCopyFileEvent</i> is COPYFILE_EVENT_ADD_PRINTER_CONNECTION or COPYFILE_EVENT_ADD_PRINTER_CONNECTION, the string supplied by <i>pszPrinterName</i> includes the server name.
