# AddPrintDeviceObject function


## -description


<div class="alert"><b>Warning</b>  <p class="note">Starting with Windows 10, the APIs which support third-party print providers are deprecated. Microsoft does not recommend any investment into third-party print providers. Additionally, on Windows 8 and newer products where the v4 print driver model is available, third-party print providers may not create or manage queues which use v4 print drivers.

</div><div> </div>The <b>AddPrintDeviceObject</b> print provider function creates a device object for a print provider queue.


## -parameters




### -param hPrinter [in]

A HANDLE to an open printer. This should be a HANDLE returned by the <b>AddPrinter</b> or <b>OpenPrinter</b> spooler functions.


### -param phDeviceObject [out]

A HANDLE to the device object, if it was created successfully.


## -returns



The <b>AddPrintDeviceObject</b> function returns S_OK, if the device object was created successfully.
    Otherwise it returns an error.




## -remarks



The <b>AddPrintDeviceObject</b> function should be called in the following situations:

<b>User installs a Printer</b>

<ul>
<li>
The print provider should call this function after installing the printer.

</li>
<li>
The function must be called by impersonating the user who is installing the printer.

</li>
</ul>
<b>Print Provider is intialized after spooler service starts</b>

<ul>
<li>
The print provider should call this function for each previously-installed Printer owned by the provider. During this time, <b>AddPrintDeviceObject</b> doesn't have to impersonate the user context when it is called.<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Any device object that is added using  <b>AddPrintDeviceObject</b> will persist until you remove it using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winsplp/nf-winsplp-removeprintdeviceobject">RemovePrintDeviceObject</a>, or 
    until the spooler service restarts. And when the spooler services stops, all the device objects are automatically deleted.</div>
<div> </div>
