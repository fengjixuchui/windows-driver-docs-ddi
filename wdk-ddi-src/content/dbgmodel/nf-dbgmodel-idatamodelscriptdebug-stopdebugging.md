# IDataModelScriptDebug::StopDebugging


## -description

The StopDebugging method is called by a client that wants to stop debugging. This method call may be made at any point after StartDebugging was made successfully (e.g.: during a break, while the script is executing, etc...). The call immediately ceases all debugging activity and resets the state back to before StartDebugging was called. 

## -parameters

### -param debugClient

The debug client which is stopping debugging. This should match the debug client passed to the StartDebugging call. A non-matching client is an illegal call.

## -returns

This method returns HRESULT that indicates success or failure.

## -remarks

## -see-also
