# IDebugHostMemory::WritePointers


## -description

 Takes a number of pointers as held in unsigned 64-bit values, truncates them to the native pointer size of the target, and writes them into the address space of the target as defined by the inpassed context and location.

## -parameters

### -param context
The host context in which to write pointers.  This represents, for example, the address space in which the location exists.

### -param location
The location at which to write pointers.  This location may represent a virtual address within the address space defined by context or it may represent something like a register within a context record for a thread.

### -param count
The number of pointers to write.

### -param pointers
The pointers to write to the debug target.  If the target is 32-bits, the pointer values here will be truncated prior to writing them to the underlying debug target.


## -returns
This method returns HRESULT which indicates success or failure.

## -remarks

## -see-also
