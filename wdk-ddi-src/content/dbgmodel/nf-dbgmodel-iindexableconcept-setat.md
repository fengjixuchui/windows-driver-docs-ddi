# IIndexableConcept::SetAt


## -description

The SetAt method attempts to set the value at a particular N-dimensional index from within the indexed object. An indexer of N-dimensions where N is the value returned from GetDimensionality must be supported. Note that an object may be indexable in different domains by different types (e.g.: indexable via both ordinals and strings). Some indexers are read-only. In such cases, E_NOTIMPL will be returned from any call to the SetAt method. 

## -parameters

### -param contextObject
The instance object (this pointer) which is being indexed is passed here.

### -param indexerCount
The number of dimensions that the object is being indexed in.

### -param indexers
An array (sized according to the indexerCount) of indicies indicating where inside the instance object to access.

### -param value
The value of the element to assign at the specified indicies.

## -returns
This method returns HRESULT which indicates success or failure.

## -remarks

**Example Implementation:** 

```cpp
IFACEMETHOD(SetAt)(_In_ IModelObject * /*pContextObject*/, 
                   _In_ ULONG64 indexerCount, 
                   _In_reads_(indexerCount) IModelObject ** /*ppIndexers*/, 
                   _In_ IModelObject * /*pValue*/)
{
    // We are read-only.  Do not allow Set.  An implementation would be very 
    // close to the implementation of GetAt (only setting some underlying 
    // value instead of fetching it)
    return E_NOTIMPL;
}
```
