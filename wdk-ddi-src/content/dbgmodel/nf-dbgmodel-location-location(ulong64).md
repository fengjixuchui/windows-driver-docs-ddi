# Location function


## -description
Constructs a location from an offset into the virtual address space of the target.


## -parameters

### -param virtualAddress
The virtual address.

## -returns
This function is a constructor and does not return value.

## -remarks

Defines the location for an object.  This particular variant of Location is the C-COM access struct.
Note that a location only has meaning in conjunction with a host context.  It is a location within
a context.  When performing an operation on the location (reading bytes, writing bytes, etc...), 
a valid host context must be supplied.
