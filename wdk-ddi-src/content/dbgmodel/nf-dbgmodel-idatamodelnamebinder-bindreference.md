# IDataModelNameBinder::BindReference


## -description

The BindReference method is similar to BindValue in that it also performs the equivalent of contextObject.name on the given object according to a set of binding rules. The result of the binding from this method is, however, a reference instead of a value. As a reference, the script provider can utilize the reference to perform assignment back to name. 

## -parameters

### -param contextObject
The object to bind a name against.

### -param name
The name to bind in the context of contextObject.

### -param reference
A reference to name in the context of contextObject is returned. As a reference binding, this can be used to support assignment back to name.

### -param metadata
Any metadata optionally associated with name is returned here.


## -returns
This method returns HRESULT that indicates success or failure.

## -remarks

## -see-also
