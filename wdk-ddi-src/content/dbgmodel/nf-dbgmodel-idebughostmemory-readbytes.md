# IDebugHostMemory::ReadBytes


## -description

Reads a number of bytes from the address space of the target as defined by the inpassed context and location.
The number of bytes read is returned in "bytesRead" upon success.

## -parameters

### -param context

The host context in which to read bytes.  This represents, for example, the address space in which the location exists.

### -param location

The location at which to read bytes.  This location may represent a virtual address within the address space defined by context or it may represent something like a register within a context record for a thread.

### -param buffer

The bytes read from the debug target will be written to this buffer.

### -param bufferSize

The size of the buffer and the number of bytes to read.

### -param bytesRead

The number of bytes actually read from the debug target will be returned here.  If the method can complete a partial read, S_FALSE will be returned and the value in bytesRead may be less than the requested number of bytes.  If the method returns S_OK, a full read was completed.

## -returns

This method returns HRESULT which indicates success or failure.

## -remarks

## -see-also
