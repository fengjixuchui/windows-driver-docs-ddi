# ArrayDimension structure


## -description

Defines the memory layout of one dimension of an array.

## -struct-fields

### -field LowerBound

The lower bounds of the array.  For C style zero based arrays, this will always be zero.  There is no uniform restriction that all arrays represented by these interfaces are zero based.

### -field Length

Defines the length of the dimension.  The dimension is considered to be of the form [LowerBound, LowerBound + Length)

### -field Stride

Defines how many bytes to move forward in memory to walk from index N of the dimension to index N + 1

## -remarks

For C-style arrays, a single array dimension is returned here with values which are always: 
LowerBound = 0

Length = ARRAYSIZE(array)

Stride = sizeof(elementType)
