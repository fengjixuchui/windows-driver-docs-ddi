# IDebugHostMemory2::LinearizeLocation


## -description

Takes a location which may represent something other than a virtual memory address and attempts to linearize the location into a virtual memory address within the given context.  This operation may fail if the location cannot be represented by a virtual address (e.g.: it's a register). 

## -parameters

### -param context
The host context in which the location is valid.  This represents, for example, the address space in which the location exists.

### -param location
The location to linearize into a virtual memory address.

### -param pLinearizedLocation
A new location representing a virtual memory address will be returned here.  If the location cannot be linearized into a virtual memory address (e.g.: the location represents an enregistered value), this method will fail.



## -returns
This method returns HRESULT which indicates success or failure.

## -remarks

## -see-also
