# IDebugHostMemory::ReadPointers


## -description

Reads a number of pointer sized objects from the address space of the target as defined by the inpassed context and location.

Each read pointer is, if necessary, zero extended to 64-bits and returned.

## -parameters

### -param context

The host context in which to read pointers.  This represents, for example, the address space in which the location exists.

### -param location

The location at which to read pointers.  This location may represent a virtual address within the address space defined by context or it may represent something like a register within a context record for a thread.

### -param count

The number of pointers to read.

### -param pointers

The pointers read from the debug target will be placed into the array passed here.  Any pointers less than 64-bits in size will be zero extended to 64-bits.

## -returns

This method returns HRESULT which indicates success or failure.

## -remarks

## -see-also
