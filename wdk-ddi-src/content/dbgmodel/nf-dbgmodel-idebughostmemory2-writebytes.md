# IDebugHostMemory2::WriteBytes


## -description

Writes a number of bytes to the address space of the target as defined by the inpassed context and location.

The number of bytes written is returned in "bytesWritten" upon success.


## -parameters

### -param context
The host context in which to write bytes.  This represents, for example, the address space in which the location exists.

### -param location
The location at which to write bytes.  This location may represent a virtual address within the address space defined by context or it may represent something like a register within a context record for a thread.

### -param buffer
The bytes to write to the debug target.

### -param bufferSize
The size of the buffer / number of bytes to write to the debug target.

### -param bytesWritten
The number of bytes actually written to the debug target will be returned here.  If the method can complete a partial write, S_FALSE will be returned and the value in bytesWritten may be less than the requested number of bytes.  If the method returns S_OK, a full write was completed.



## -returns
This method returns HRESULT.
## -remarks
