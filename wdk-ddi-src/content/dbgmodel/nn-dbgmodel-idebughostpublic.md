# IDebugHostPublic interface

## -description

An ([IDebugHostSymbol](nn-dbgmodel-idebughostsymbol.md) derived) interface to a public symbol (address/name only).

Represents a symbol within the publics table of a PDB. This does not have type information associated with it. It is a name and address.


## -inheritance
IDebugHostPublic interits from [IDebugHostSymbol](nn-dbgmodel-idebughostsymbol.md). 
## -remarks

Public symbols represent things in the public table within a symbol file. They are, in effect, export addresses. There is no type information associated with a public symbol -- only an address. Unless a public symbol is explicitly requested by the caller, the debug host prefers to return private symbols for every inquiry. A public symbol is expressed by the IDebugHostPublic interface.
