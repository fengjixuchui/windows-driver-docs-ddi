# SignatureComparison enumeration

## -description

Describes how a type or two signatures compare.

## -enum-fields

### -field Unrelated 
The two signatures/types being compared are unrelated.

### -field Ambiguous 
One signature/type compares ambiguously against the other.  For instance, std::pair<*, int> versus std::pair<int, *> are ambiguous.  There are types that would
 match both of these equally well (e.g.: std::pair<int, int>) 
 
### -field LessSpecific 
One signature/type is less specific than the other.  For instance, a comparison of std::vector<*> against std::vector<int> would yield LessSpecific.

### -field MoreSpecific 
One signature/type is more specific than the other.  For instance, a comparison of std::vector<int> against std::vector<*> would yield MoreSpecific.

### -field Identical 
The signatures/types are identical.
