# IWDFDevice interface


## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IWDFDevice</b> interface exposes a device object, which is a representation of a device on the system.

## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IWDFDevice</b> interface inherits from <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nn-wudfddi-iwdfobject">IWDFObject</a>. <b>IWDFDevice</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>
</ul>

## -remarks

Each device object has a parent driver object. When a new device arrives in the system, the framework calls the parent driver's <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-idriverentry-ondeviceadd">IDriverEntry::OnDeviceAdd</a> callback function to notify the driver about the arrival. The driver can then call the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfdriver-createdevice">IWDFDriver::CreateDevice</a> method to receive a pointer to the <b>IWDFDevice</b> interface for the new device object.
