## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> method retrieves the name of an underlying kernel-mode device.

## -parameters

### -param pDeviceName 

[out]
A pointer to a buffer that receives a <b>NULL</b>-terminated string that represents the name of the underlying kernel-mode device, if the buffer is non-<b>NULL</b> and <b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> is successful.

### -param pdwDeviceNameLength 

[in, out]
A pointer to a variable that receives the number of characters, including the <b>NULL</b> character, in the device name.

If the buffer at <i>pDeviceName</i> is <b>NULL</b>, the value that the driver supplies is zero. The framework then returns the size, in characters, that is required for the device name string.

If the buffer at <i>pDeviceName</i> is non-<b>NULL</b>, the framework returns the size, in characters, of the device name string.

## -returns

<b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> returns S_OK for the following scenarios: 


<ul>
<li>The buffer that the <i>pDeviceName</i> parameter pointed to was non-<b>NULL</b> and large enough to hold the name string, including the <b>NULL</b> character, and the framework successfully copied the string into the supplied buffer and set the variable that is pointed to by <i>pdwDeviceNameLength</i> to the number of characters in the string.</li>
<li>The buffer at <i>pDeviceName</i> was <b>NULL</b>, the driver preset the variable at <i>pdwDeviceNameLength</i> to 0, and the framework set the variable at <i>pdwDeviceNameLength</i> to the number of characters that were required for the string.</li>
</ul>


<b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> returns HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER) to indicate that the supplied buffer was non-<b>NULL</b> and did not contain enough space to hold the device name. The framework sets the variable at <i>pdwDeviceNameLength</i> to the number of characters that are required for the string.

<b>RetrieveDeviceName</b> might also return other HRESULT values.

## -remarks

The device name is not the physical device object (PDO) name. Instead, the device name is the name of the reflector. The driver must target all I/O to this device object.


#### Examples

The following code example shows how to retrieve the name of an underlying kernel-mode device.


```
    PWSTR deviceName = NULL;
    DWORD deviceNameCch = 0;
    HRESULT hr;
    //
    // Get the length of the device name to allocate a buffer
    //
    hr = m_FxDevice->RetrieveDeviceName(NULL, &deviceNameCch);
    //
    // Allocate the buffer
    //
    deviceName = new WCHAR[deviceNameCch];

    if (deviceName == NULL) {
        hr = E_OUTOFMEMORY;
        goto Exit1;
    }
    //
    // Get the device name
    //
    hr = m_FxDevice->RetrieveDeviceName(deviceName,
                                        &deviceNameCch);

    // Open the device and get the handle

    m_Handle = CreateFile(deviceName, 
                         (GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE), 
                         0, 
                         NULL, 
                         OPEN_EXISTING, 
                         FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, 
                         NULL);
```
