For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IWDFRequestCompletionParams</b> interface exposes methods that drivers can use to obtain completion information about an I/O request. Drivers can call these methods after a synchronous or an asynchronous I/O operation completes.
