For more information about impersonation in the UMDF, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/handling-client-impersonation-in-umdf-drivers">Handling Client Impersonation</a>.

A UMDF driver supplies one of the values of <b>SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</b> to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfiorequest-impersonate">IWDFIoRequest::Impersonate</a> method to set the security impersonation level.

For more information about the security impersonation levels, see the <b>SECURITY_IMPERSONATION_LEVEL</b> enumeration type in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
