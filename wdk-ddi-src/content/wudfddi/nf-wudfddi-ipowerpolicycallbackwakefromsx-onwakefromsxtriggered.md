# IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx::OnWakeFromSxTriggered


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

A driver's <b>OnWakeFromSxTriggered</b> event callback function informs the driver that its device, which had previously entered a low-power device state because system power was reduced, might have triggered a wake signal.


## -parameters




### -param pWdfDevice [in]

A pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nn-wudfddi-iwdfdevice">IWDFDevice</a> interface of the device object that represents one of the driver's devices.


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



Your driver must provide an <b>OnWakeFromSxTriggered</b> callback function if the driver supports the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nn-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefromsx">IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx</a> interface. 

If the driver has registered this callback, the framework calls it after calling the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-ipnpcallback-ond0entry">IPnpCallback::OnD0Entry</a> callback function and before calling the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-ipowerpolicycallbackwakefromsx-ondisarmwakefromsx">IPowerPolicyCallbackWakeFromSx::OnDisarmWakeFromSx</a> callback function.

System hardware (BIOSes, motherboards, bus adapters) can sometimes drop a wake signal before the bus driver detects it, even though the signal wakes up the system. In such cases, the driver's <b>OnWakeFromSxTriggered</b> callback function will not be called even though the driver's device triggered a wake signal.

For more information about this callback function, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/supporting-system-wake-up-in-umdf-drivers">Supporting System Wake-Up in UMDF-based Drivers</a>.
