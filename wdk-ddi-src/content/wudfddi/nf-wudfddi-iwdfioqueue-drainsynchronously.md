# IWDFIoQueue::DrainSynchronously


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>DrainSynchronously</b> method directs the queue to reject new incoming I/O requests and allows already-queued requests to be delivered to the driver for processing. This method returns after all requests are completed or canceled.


## -remarks



The <b>DrainSynchronously</b> method is a synchronous version of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfioqueue-drain">IWDFIoQueue::Drain</a> method. That is, <b>DrainSynchronously</b> does not return to the driver until the queue is drained.
