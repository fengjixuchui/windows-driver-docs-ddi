# IWDFObject::AcquireLock


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>AcquireLock</b> method prevents the framework from calling methods of interfaces that a driver registered.


## -parameters






## -returns



None




## -remarks



If a driver configured itself to use the <b>AcquireLock</b> locking scheme, the framework automatically acquires the "presentation" lock before calling into the driver. (For more information about this locking scheme, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/specifying-a-callback-synchronization-mode">Specifying a Callback Synchronization Mode</a>.) The <b>AcquireLock</b> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfobject-releaselock">IWDFObject::ReleaseLock</a> methods acquire and release the presentation lock, respectively. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/creating-a-framework-device-object">Framework device objects</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/framework-i-o-queue-object">framework I/O queue objects</a> currently support the <b>AcquireLock</b> method.

The driver calls the <b>AcquireLock</b> method to manipulate its objects that were created from its callback interfaces outside the callback scope in a thread-safe manner. The <b>AcquireLock</b> method represents an advanced feature of the framework that most drivers will not use because improper usage can result in deadlocks.

Unsynchronized code can call <b>AcquireLock</b>. The driver should call on objects that match its synchronization scope.


#### Examples

For a code example of how to use the <b>AcquireLock</b> method, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice-setpnpstate">IWDFDevice::SetPnpState</a>.
