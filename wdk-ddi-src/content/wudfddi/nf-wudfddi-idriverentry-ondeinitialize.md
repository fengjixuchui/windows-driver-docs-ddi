# IDriverEntry::OnDeinitialize


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>OnDeinitialize</b> method performs any operations that are necessary before a system unloads a driver.


## -parameters




### -param pWdfDriver [in]

A pointer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nn-wudfddi-iwdfdriver">IWDFDriver</a> interface for the driver object that represents the driver that the system unloads.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



The framework creates a new driver object for each driver that is loaded in the driver host process. When a driver is about to be unloaded from the host process, the framework calls <b>OnDeinitialize</b> to notify the driver of the departure and passes the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nn-wudfddi-iwdfdriver">IWDFDriver</a> interface in the call. The system unloads the driver after <b>OnDeinitialize</b> returns.
