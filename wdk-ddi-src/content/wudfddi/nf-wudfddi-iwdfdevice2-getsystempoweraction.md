## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b> method returns the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/system-power-actions">system power action</a>, if any, that is currently occurring for the computer.

## -returns

<b>GetSystemPowerAction</b> returns a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ne-wdm-ppower_action">POWER_ACTION</a>-typed enumerator value. The value indicates the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/system-power-actions">system power action</a> that is currently occurring for the computer. For more information, see the following Remarks section.

## -remarks

The <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b> method enables a driver to determine whether a device's power transition is occurring because the device is idle (or waking up), or because the entire computer is entering (or leaving) a low-power state. 

The driver must call <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b> only from the event callback functions that the framework calls when the device is <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/a-device-enters-a-low-power-state">entering a low-power state</a> or <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/a-device-returns-to-its-working-state">returning to its working state</a>. 

The value that <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b> returns depends on the following situations:

<ul>
<li>
If the computer is entering a low-power state when the driver calls <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b>, the method returns the reason that the computer is entering the low-power state. For example, the method returns <b>PowerActionSleep</b> if the computer is entering its S1, S2, or S3 low-power state.

</li>
<li>
If the computer is returning to its working (S0) state from a low-power state when the driver calls <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b>, the method returns the reason that the computer entered the low-power state. For example, the method returns <b>PowerActionSleep</b> if the computer is leaving its S1, S2, or S3 low-power state.

</li>
<li>
If the computer is powering up (after having been turned off) when the driver calls <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b>, the method returns <b>PowerActionNone</b>.

</li>
<li>
If the device is entering a low-power idle state or returning to its working (D0) state when the driver calls <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b>, while the rest of the system remains at its working (S0) state, the method returns <b>PowerActionNone</b>.

</li>
<li>
If the computer and the device are both in their working states when the driver calls <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b>, the method returns <b>PowerActionNone</b>.

</li>
</ul>
For more information about low-power states, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/a-device-enters-a-low-power-state">A Device Enters a Low-Power State</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example obtains the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nn-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2">IWDFDevice2</a> interface and then calls <b>GetSystemPowerAction</b>.


```
   IWDFDevice2 *pDevice2 = NULL;
    HRESULT hrQI = pDevice->QueryInterface(IID_PPV_ARGS(&pDevice2));
    if (SUCCEEDED(hrQI))
    {
        POWER_ACTION powerAction = pDevice2->GetSystemPowerAction();
    }
...
    SAFE_RELEASE(pDevice2);
```
