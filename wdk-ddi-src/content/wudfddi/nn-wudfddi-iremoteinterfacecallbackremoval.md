# IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval interface


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[<b>Warning:</b> UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1.  All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2.  No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10.  Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2.  For more info, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">Getting Started with UMDF</a>.]

The <b>IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval</b> provides a callback function that the framework calls to notify the driver about the removal of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-device-interfaces-in-umdf-drivers">device interface</a>.


## -inheritance

The <b xmlns:loc="http://microsoft.com/wdcml/l10n">IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval</b> interface inherits from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface. <b>IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval</b> also has these types of members:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/">Methods</a></li>

A UMDF-based driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iremoteinterfacecallbackremoval-onremoteinterfaceremoval">OnRemoteInterfaceRemoval</a> event callback function notifies the driver that it cannot use a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-device-interfaces-in-umdf-drivers">device interface</a> because the interface has been removed.

## -remarks



If your driver supports an <b>IRemoteInterfaceCallbackRemoval</b> interface for a device, the <b>IUnknown::QueryInterface</b> method that the driver passes to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfdevice2-createremoteinterface">IWDFDevice2::CreateRemoteInterface</a> must return the interface.
