# _UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES structure


## -description


The <b>UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</b> structure is used USB to define properties of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) device created by the controller.


## -struct-fields




### -field Size

Size of the <b>UFX_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES</b> structure.


### -field MaxSpeed

Indicates the maximum USB speed supported by the device.


### -field RemoteWakeSignalDelay

The minimum time interval in milliseconds to wait after being suspended before requesting remote wakeup.


### -field PdcpSupported

If  <b>true</b>, indicates the client driver supports proprietary charger detection.


### -field InEndpointBitmap

A bitmap that defines which endpoint numbers can support an IN endpoint.  Bit 0 indicates endpoint address 0, bit 1 indicates endpoint address 1, etc.   Bit 0 (the default control endpoint) is required to be set to 1.


### -field OutEndpointBitmap

A bitmap that defines which endpoint numbers can support an OUT endpoint.  Bit 0 indicates endpoint address 0, bit 1 indicates endpoint address 1, etc.   Bit 0 (the default control endpoint) is required to be set to 1.

### -field SharesConnectors
A boolean value that indicates the connector supports multiple connectors.
 
### -field GroupId
 The group identifier the shared connector group to which a  controller will be added.
