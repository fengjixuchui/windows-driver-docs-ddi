# D3DDDI_UPDATEALLOCPROPERTY structure


## -description

D3DDDI_UPDATEALLOCPROPERTY describes the parameters needed to update an allocation.

## -struct-fields

### -field hPagingQueue

[in] A Handle to the paging queue used to synchronize paging operations for this call.

### -field hAllocation

[in] A handle to the allocation that will be updated.

### -field SupportedSegmentSet

[in] An index for the new supported segment set. If the current supported segment set is the same, then this will be ignored.

### -field PreferredSegment

[in] An index for the new preferred segment set. If the current preferred segment set is the same, then this will be ignored.

### -field Flags

[in] The flags that will be used to update the allocation.

### -field PagingFenceValue

[out] The paging fence value that will be synchronized with before using the new allocation. Applies to the monitored fence synchronization object associated with hPagingQueue.

### -field SetAccessedPhysically

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is accessed by its physical address.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>PropertyMaskValue</b> member (0x00000001).

### -field SetSupportedSegmentSet

A UINT value that specifies whether the supported segment is set to a new value.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>PropertyMaskValue</b> member (0x00000010).

### -field SetPreferredSegment

A UINT value that specifies whether the preferred segment is set to a new value.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>PropertyMaskValue</b> member (0x00000100).

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 29 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of the 32-bit <b>PropertyMaskValue</b> member to zeros.

### -field PropertyMaskValue

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_UPDATEALLOCPROPERTY that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies how to update an allocation.
