## -description



The <b>D3DDDICB_DESTROYALLOCATION2FLAGS</b> structure is used with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_destroyallocation2">D3DKMT_DESTROYALLOCATION2</a> structure to describe parameters for releasing allocations with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtdestroyallocation2">D3DKMTDestroyAllocation2</a>.
