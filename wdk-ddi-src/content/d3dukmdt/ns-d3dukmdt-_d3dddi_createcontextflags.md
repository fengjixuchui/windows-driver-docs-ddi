# _D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS structure


## -description


The D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS structure describes how to create a context in a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff568895(v=vs.85)">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field NullRendering

A UINT value that specifies whether the graphics processing unit (GPU) should process any commands that are sent by the context that is created. The <b>NullRendering</b> bit-field flag is set to inform the GPU not to process any commands that are sent by the context. The <b>NullRendering</b> bit-field flag is set only during performance investigating and debugging to simulate an infinitely fast rendering engine that still must perform the overhead of DMA buffer submission and signaling. <b>NullRendering</b> is never set during typical operations.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field InitialData

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field DisableGpuTimeout

 


### -field SynchronizationOnly

 


### -field HwQueueSupported

 


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 30 bits (0xFFFFFFFD) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies how to create the context.
