## -description

A structure used to create hardware queue flags.

## -struct-fields

### -field Value

This value is used to operate over the members collectively.

### -field DisableGpuTimeout

When set, indicates to the OS that the hardware queue being created is expected to submit DMA buffers that can take longer than 2 seconds to complete on the GPU, and consequently GPU timeout should be disabled.

### -field NoBroadcastSignal

When set, indicates to the OS that the hardware queue being created does not have application observable behavior, and it should not participate in D3D12 command queue fence broadcast signal operation. This flag was introduced in Windows 10, version 2004.

### -field NoBroadcastWait

When set, indicates to the OS that the hardware queue being created does not have application observable behavior, and it should not be blocked behind in D3D12 command queue fence wait operation. This flag was introduced in Windows 10, version 2004.

### -field Reserved

This value is reserved for system use.
