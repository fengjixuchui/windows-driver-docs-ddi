# D3DDDI_RESERVEGPUVIRTUALADDRESS structure


## -description

<b>D3DDDI_RESERVEGPUVIRTUALADDRESS</b> is used with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_reservegpuvirtualaddresscb">pfnReserveGpuVirtualAddressCb</a> to reserve an address range in the graphics processing unit (GPU) virtual address space of the current process.

## -struct-fields

### -field hPagingQueue

Paging queue to synchronize the operation on.

### -field hAdapter

DirectX graphics adapter handle.

### -field BaseAddress

(Optional) If <b>non-NULL</b>, the video memory manager will attempt to use this address as the base address for the reserved range. If the range from <b>BaseAddress</b> to <b>BaseAddress</b>+<b>Size</b> isn’t free, the call will fail. When this parameter is <b>non-NULL</b>, <b>MinimumAddress</b> and <b>MaximumAddress</b> are ignored.

<b>BaseAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.


If <b>NULL</b> is specified the video memory manager will pick the base address for the allocation within the specified <b>MinimumAddress</b> and <b>MaximumAddress</b>.

### -field MinimumAddress

(Optional) Specifies the minimum GPU virtual address to consider for the reserved range.

<b>MinimumAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.

This parameter is ignored when <b>BaseAddress</b> != <b>NULL</b>.

### -field MaximumAddress

(Optional) Specifies the maximum GPU virtual address to consider for the reserved range. the video memory manager will guarantee that <b>BaseAddress</b>+<b>Size</b> <= <b>MaximumAddress</b>. If this is set to NULL the video memory manager will not apply any limit.

<b>MaximumAddress</b> is in bytes and must be aligned to 64KB boundary.

This parameter is ignored when <b>BaseAddress</b> != <b>NULL</b>.

### -field Size

Specify the size of the range to reserve in bytes. Must be a multiple of 64KB.

### -field ReservationType

Specifies the virtual address reservation type.

### -field Reserved0

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.

### -field DriverProtection

Specifies the driver-specific protection

### -field Reserved1

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.

### -field VirtualAddress

[out] The reserved virtual address.

### -field PagingFenceValue

Paging fence identifier for synchronization

### -field Reserved2

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.
