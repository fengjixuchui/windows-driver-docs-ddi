# _D3DKMT_OPENRESOURCEFROMNTHANDLE structure


## -description


Describes information that is required to open a shared resource from an NT handle to the process. The shared resource can be a set of allocations, a keyed mutex, or a synchronization object.


## -struct-fields




### -field hDevice

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents the device.


### -field hNtHandle

[in] An NT handle to the process.


### -field NumAllocations

[in] The number of allocations associated with the resource.


### -field pOpenAllocationInfo2

[in] This member is reserved and should be set to zero.


### -field PrivateRuntimeDataSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by the <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> member.


### -field pPrivateRuntimeData

[in] A caller-supplied buffer where the runtime private data associated with this resource will be copied to.


### -field ResourcePrivateDriverDataSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the  buffer pointed to by the <b>pResourcePrivateDriverData</b> member.


### -field pResourcePrivateDriverData

[in] A caller-supplied buffer where the driver private data associated with the resource will be copied to.


### -field TotalPrivateDriverDataBufferSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by the <b>pTotalPrivateDriverDataBuffer</b> member.

[out] The size, in bytes, of  the data written to <b>pTotalPrivateDriverDataBuffer</b>.


### -field pTotalPrivateDriverDataBuffer

[in] A pointer to a caller-supplied buffer where the driver private data will be stored.


### -field hResource

[out] A handle to the resource in this process.


### -field hKeyedMutex

[out] A handle to the keyed mutex in this process.


### -field pKeyedMutexPrivateRuntimeData

[in] A buffer that contains initial private data.

The data in this buffer will be copied only if the keyed mutex does not already have private data.

If this member has a value of <b>NULL</b>, the value of the <b>KeyedMutexPrivateRuntimeDataSize</b> member must be zero.


### -field KeyedMutexPrivateRuntimeDataSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by the <b>pKeyedMutexPrivateRuntimeData</b> member.


### -field hSyncObject

[out] A handle to the synchronization object in this process.
