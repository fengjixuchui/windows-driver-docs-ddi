## -remarks



For a description of ownership levels of video present sources, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtsetvidpnsourceowner">D3DKMTSetVidPnSourceOwner</a> function and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_setvidpnsourceowner">D3DKMT_SETVIDPNSOURCEOWNER</a> structure.
