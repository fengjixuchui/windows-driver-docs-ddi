# _D3DKMT_SETQUEUEDLIMIT structure


## -description


The D3DKMT_SETQUEUEDLIMIT structure describes parameters for setting or retrieving the limit for the number of operations of the given type that can be queued for the given device. 


## -struct-fields




### -field hDevice

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents the kernel-mode handle to the device to set or retrieve the limit of queued operations for.


### -field Type

[in] A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/ne-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_queuedlimit_type">D3DKMT_QUEUEDLIMIT_TYPE</a>-typed value that indicates the type of operations to set or retrieve the queued limit for. 


### -field QueuedPresentLimit

[in/out] The limit for the number of present operations that can be queued for the device that is specified by <b>hDevice</b>. If the OpenGL installable client driver (ICD) sets <b>QueuedPresentLimit</b> to 0, the limit for the device is reset to the graphics adapter's default value, which is currently 3. The union that is contained in D3DKMT_SETQUEUEDLIMIT contains the limiting number if the <b>Type</b> member is D3DKMT_SET_QUEUEDLIMIT_PRESENT and retrieves the number if <b>Type</b> is D3DKMT_GET_QUEUEDLIMIT_PRESENT. 


### -field VidPnSourceId

[in] An integer that identifies a video present source that is in the path of a video present network (VidPN) topology. The union that is contained in D3DKMT_SETQUEUEDLIMIT contains the integer if the present operations are flips. 


### -field QueuedPendingFlipLimit

[in/out] The limit for the number of flip operations that can be queued for the device that is specified by <b>hDevice</b>. If the OpenGL ICD sets <b>QueuedPendingFlipLimit</b> to 0, the limit for the device is reset to the graphics adapter's default value, which is currently 1. The union that is contained in D3DKMT_SETQUEUEDLIMIT contains the limiting number if the present operations are flips.
