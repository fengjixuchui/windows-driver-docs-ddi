# _D3DKMT_PRESENT_MULTIPLANE_OVERLAY_FLAGS structure

## -description

Present multi-plane overlay flags.

## -struct-fields

### -field FlipStereo

Specifies whether the driver should flip both left and right images of a stereo allocation.

### -field FlipStereoTemporaryMono

Specifies whether the driver should use the left image of a stereo allocation for the right and left portions of a stereo frame. The driver performs the same present operation as with <b>FlipStereo</b>, except that it should scan out only from the left image to produce both images of a stereo frame.

### -field FlipStereoPreferRight

Specifies that when the driver clones a stereo primary allocation to a mono monitor, it should use the right image.

The **FlipStereoTemporaryMono** and **FlipStereoPreferRight** members can't both be set at the same time.

### -field FlipDoNotWait

A UINT value that specifies whether the OpenGL installable client driver (ICD) requires that the present operation wait for the number of queued flip surfaces to fall below a particular limit before the operation begins. Setting this member indicates that the ICD does not require waiting. The default limit for the number of queued flip surfaces is three.

### -field FlipDoNotFlip

A UINT value that specifies whether to insert queued waits into the rendering stream. Setting this member indicates to flip to the same surface that is currently being scanned out.

### -field FlipRestart

A UINT value that specifies whether to restart a flip to a new surface.

### -field DurationValid

Indicates whether the duration is valid.

### -field HDRMetaDataValid

Indicates whether the HDR metadata is valide.

### -field HMD

The HMD (head mounted display). 

### -field TrueImmediate

The true immediate.

### -field Reserved

Reserved for internal use.

### -field Value
 
The value used to operate over the other members.
