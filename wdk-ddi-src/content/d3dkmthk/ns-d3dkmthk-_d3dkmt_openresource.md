# _D3DKMT_OPENRESOURCE structure


## -description


The D3DKMT_OPENRESOURCE structure describes parameters for opening a resource.


## -struct-fields




### -field hDevice

[in] A handle to the device that the resource and allocations are associated with.


### -field hGlobalShare

[in] A handle to the shared resource to open.


### -field NumAllocations

[in] The number of elements in the array that <b>pOpenAllocationInfo</b> specifies, which represents the number of allocations that are associated with the resource.


### -field pOpenAllocationInfo

[in/out] An array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dukmdt/ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_openallocationinfo">D3DDDI_OPENALLOCATIONINFO</a> structures that describe each allocation to update.


### -field pOpenAllocationInfo2

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.

This member is available beginning with Windows 7.


### -field pPrivateRuntimeData

[in] A pointer to a caller-supplied buffer where the OpenGL runtime copies private data that is associated with the resource.


### -field PrivateRuntimeDataSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> points to.


### -field pResourcePrivateDriverData

[in/out] A pointer to a buffer that receives the private data that is associated with the resource. This data is per resource and not per allocation.


### -field ResourcePrivateDriverDataSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that <b>pResourcePrivateDriverData</b> points to.


### -field pTotalPrivateDriverDataBuffer

[in/out] A pointer to a buffer that receives the private data for all of the allocations that are associated with the resource. The caller should never access this private data directly.


### -field TotalPrivateDriverDataBufferSize

[in/out] On input, the size, in bytes, of the buffer that <b>pTotalPrivateDriverDataBuffer</b> points to. On output, this member specifies the size, in bytes, of data that is written to the buffer that <b>pTotalPrivateDriverDataBuffer</b> points to.


### -field hResource

[out] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the newly opened shared resource that is associated with the allocations.
