# D3DKMTEscape function


## -description

The <b>D3DKMTEscape</b> function exchanges information with the display miniport driver.

## -parameters

### -param D3DKMT_ESCAPE

*pData* [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_escape">D3DKMT_ESCAPE</a> structure that describes the exchanged information.

## -returns

<b>D3DKMTEscape</b> returns one of the following values:

| **Return code** | **Description** | 
|:--|:--|
| **STATUS_SUCCESS** | Information was successfully shared. | 
| **STATUS_DEVICE_REMOVED** | The graphics adapter was stopped or the display device was reset. | 
| **STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER** | Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect. | 
| **STATUS_NO_MEMORY** | [D3DKMTEscape](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtescape)  could not complete because of insufficient memory. | 
| **STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION** | [D3DKMTEscape](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtescape)  detected nonprivileged instructions (that is, instructions that access memory beyond the privilege of the current CPU process). | 
| **STATUS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION** | [D3DKMTEscape](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtescape)  detected instructions that cannot be supported by graphics hardware. | 

This function might also return other <b>NTSTATUS</b> values.

## -remarks

The OpenGL ICD calls <b>D3DKMTEscape</b> to exchange data directly with the display miniport driver. For testing purposes, the OpenGL ICD can also call <b>D3DKMTEscape</b> to control the video memory manager and graphics processing unit (GPU) scheduler (which are part of <i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>) and the behavior of the operating system's Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) process. 

Hardware vendors can use <b>D3DKMTEscape</b> in their OpenGL ICDs as an extension mechanism. However, vendors should report necessary extensions to Microsoft so the extensions can be natively supported by the operating system.
