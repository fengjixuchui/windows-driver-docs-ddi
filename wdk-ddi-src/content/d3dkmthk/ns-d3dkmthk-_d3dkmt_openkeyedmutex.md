## -description

The D3DKMT_OPENKEYEDMUTEX structure describes a keyed mutex that the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtopenkeyedmutex">D3DKMTOpenKeyedMutex</a> function opens.

## -struct-fields

### -field hSharedHandle

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode shared global handle to the keyed mutex object.

### -field hKeyedMutex

[out] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the keyed mutex object in the current process.
