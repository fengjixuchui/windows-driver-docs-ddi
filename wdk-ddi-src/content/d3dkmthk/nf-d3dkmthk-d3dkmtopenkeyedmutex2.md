## -description

Opens a keyed mutex object that includes private data.

## -parameters

### -param Arg1

*pData* [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_openkeyedmutex2">D3DKMT_OPENKEYEDMUTEX2</a> structure that describes a keyed mutex object that includes private data.

## -returns

| **Return code** | **Description** | 
|:--|:--|
| **STATUS_SUCCESS** | The keyed mutex object was successfully opened. | 
| **STATUS_DEVICE_REMOVED** | The graphics adapter was stopped or the display device was reset. | 
| **STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER** | Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect. | 
| **STATUS_NO_MEMORY** | [D3DKMTOpenKeyedMutex2](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtopenkeyedmutex2)  could not complete because of insufficient memory. | 

This function might also return other NTSTATUS values.

## -remarks

<b>D3DKMTOpenKeyedMutex2</b> behaves like the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtopenkeyedmutex">D3DKMTOpenKeyedMutex</a> function but lets the caller specify private data to associate with the keyed mutex.
