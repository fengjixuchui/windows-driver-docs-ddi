# _D3DKMT_SIGNALSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT2 structure


## -description

The D3DKMT_SIGNALSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT2 structure contains information about the synchronization events that the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtsignalsynchronizationobject2">D3DKMTSignalSynchronizationObject2</a> function signals.

## -struct-fields

### -field hContext

[in] A kernel-mode handle to a context that signals the synchronization events in the array that the <b>ObjectHandleArray</b> member specifies.

### -field ObjectCount

[in] The number of synchronization events in the <b>ObjectHandleArray</b> array.

### -field ObjectHandleArray

[in] An array of kernel-mode handles to the synchronization events that the context that is specified by the <b>hContext</b> member signals. The D3DDDI_MAX_OBJECT_SIGNALED constant, which is defined as 32, indicates the maximum number of synchronization events that the context can signal.

### -field Flags

[in] A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dukmdt/ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddicb_signalflags">D3DDDICB_SIGNALFLAGS</a> structure that indicates, in bit-field flags, signaling behavior.

### -field BroadcastContextCount

[in] The number of additional contexts in the array that <b>BroadcastContext</b> specifies.

### -field BroadcastContext

[in] An array of D3DKMT_HANDLE data types that represent kernel-mode handles to the additional contexts to broadcast the event to. The D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT constant, which is defined as 64, defines the maximum number of contexts that the OpenGL ICD can broadcast the event to.

The original context that the <b>hContext</b> member specifies and that owns the event is not an element in the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array. For example, if the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array contains one element, the OpenGL ICD sends the event to the owning context (<b>hContext</b>) and broadcasts to that one additional context.

### -field Fence

A structure that contains information about a fence. The union in D3DKMT_SIGNALSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT2 can hold a Fence structure, which contains the following member:

### -field Fence.FenceValue

A 64-bit value that specifies the fence value to signal.

### -field CpuEventHandle

A handle to a CPU event that is to be signaled.

Supported starting with WindowsÂ 8.

### -field Reserved

An array of 64-bit values that are reserved for future use. The union in D3DKMT_SIGNALSYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT2 can hold this array.
