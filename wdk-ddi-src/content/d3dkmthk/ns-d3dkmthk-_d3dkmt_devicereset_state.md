## -description

The D3DKMT_DEVICERESET_STATE structure identifies reset status.

## -struct-fields

### -field DesktopSwitched

A UINT value that specifies whether the desktop that the calling process is created on switched from being visible to being invisible. For example, when the security screen appears because a user pressed CTRL+ALT+DEL, the desktop that the calling process is created on becomes invisible. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.

### -field Value

A 32-bit value that identifies reset status.
