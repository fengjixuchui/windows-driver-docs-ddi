# _D3DKMT_PRESENT_STATS structure


## -description


The D3DKMT_PRESENT_STATS structure describes present status for a rendering device.


## -struct-fields




### -field PresentCount

[out] A UINT value that indicates the number of times that the OpenGL installable client driver (ICD) called the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtpresent">D3DKMTPresent</a> function on a rendering device or swap chain. After the maximum value is reached, <b>PresentCount</b> starts over at zero. When a new rendering device is created, <b>PresentCount</b> is initialized to zero. The operating system maintains a present counter for each swap chain that is created.


### -field PresentRefreshCount

[out] A UINT value that indicates the number of times the display controller outputs a new video frame, which occurs at the beginning of each vertical retrace period. The operating system maintains a present refresh counter for each video display controller output in the operating system. <b>PresentRefreshCount</b> is initialized to an unspecified value. 


### -field SyncRefreshCount

[out] A UINT value that indicates the number of the most recent capture of the timing information in the <b>SyncQPCTime</b> and <b>SyncGPUTime</b> members.


### -field SyncQPCTime

[out] The computer processing unit (CPU) time that the current video frame was output at (that is, the CPU time that the vertical retrace started).


### -field SyncGPUTime

[out] The graphics processing unit (GPU) time that the current video frame was output at (that is, the GPU time that the vertical retrace started).


## -remarks



When a present operation is retired, the operating system maintains a correspondence (mapping) between the value in <b>PresentCount</b> and the value in <b>PresentRefreshCount</b>; that is, when the operating system finishes a present operation as a scanned out video frame, the value in <b>PresentRefreshCount</b> that the present operation was finished with is associated with the value in <b>PresentCount</b> of the retired present operation. 

The operating system maintains timing information within a rendering device and associates the timing information with a display output. When the GPU can maintain the GPU time (<b>SyncGPUTime</b>), the GPU time operates at a device-specific frequency. To let applications relate GPU time to other operations in the system, the operating system maintains a correspondence between GPU time and CPU time (<b>SyncQPCTime</b>). When the GPU cannot maintain such GPU time, the operating system maintains only CPU time and the associated GPU time is always zero. 

Present statistics cannot work for windowed-mode devices. For windowed mode, each structure member is set to zero.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    The operating system might not update the <b>SyncRefreshCount</b>, <b>SyncQPCTime</b>, and <b>SyncGPUTime</b> members on every frame.</div>
