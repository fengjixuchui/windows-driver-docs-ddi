## -description


The D3DKMT_PRESENTFLAGS structure identifies how to perform a present operation.


## -struct-fields




### -field Blt

A UINT value that specifies whether to bit-block transfer (bitblt) data to the primary surface. This bit-field flag can be used with the <b>DstRectValid</b> and <b>SrcRectValid</b> bit-field flags.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field ColorFill

A UINT value that specifies whether to perform a colorfill bitblt to the primary surface by using the value in the <b>Color</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_present">D3DKMT_PRESENT</a> structure. This bit-field flag can be used with the <b>DstRectValid</b> bit-field flag.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field Flip

A UINT value that specifies whether to flip to a new surface.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).


### -field FlipDoNotFlip

A UINT value that specifies whether to insert queued waits into the rendering stream. Setting this member indicates to flip to the same surface that is currently being scanned out.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).


### -field FlipDoNotWait

A UINT value that specifies whether the OpenGL installable client driver (ICD) requires that the present operation wait for the number of queued flip surfaces to fall below a particular limit before the operation begins. Setting this member indicates that the ICD does not require waiting. The default limit for the number of queued flip surfaces is three.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fifth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000010).


### -field FlipRestart

A UINT value that specifies whether to restart a flip to a new surface.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the sixth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000020).


### -field DstRectValid

A UINT value that specifies whether the bitblt uses a destination rectangular area.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the seventh bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000040).


### -field SrcRectValid

A UINT value that specifies whether the bitblt uses a source rectangular area.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the eighth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000080).


### -field RestrictVidPnSource

If the <b>hWindow</b> member is <b>NULL</b>, the <b>VidPnSourceId</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_present">D3DKMT_PRESENT</a> structure indicates which output the full-screen bitblt is directed to; if <b>hWindow</b> is non-<b>NULL</b>, <b>VidPnSourceId</b> indicates which output to restrict the windowed bitblt to.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the ninth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000100).


### -field SrcColorKey

A UINT value that specifies whether to perform source color-keying by using the value in the <b>Color</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_present">D3DKMT_PRESENT</a> structure. That is, any pixel in the source surface that matches the color key should not be copied to the destination surface, and all of the source pixels that do not match the color key should be copied.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the tenth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000200).


### -field DstColorKey

### -field LinearToSrgb

A UINT value that specifies whether to convert the linear-formatted source to sRGB format during the copy operation. sRGB format is gamma corrected. For more information about sRGB format, see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=10112">sRGB</a> website.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the twelfth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000800).


### -field PresentCountValid

A UINT value that specifies whether the value set in the <b>PresentCount</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_present">D3DKMT_PRESENT</a> structure is valid.
