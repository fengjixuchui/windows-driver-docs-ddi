## -struct-fields

### -field Saturated

Driver should set this state flag if the driver cannot go higher than specified. This includes transient states like thermal limits.

The tracked workload is in the current state of execution, and it cannot meet its deadline.

### -field Reserved

Reserved for internal use.

### -field Value
 
The value used to operate over the other members.
