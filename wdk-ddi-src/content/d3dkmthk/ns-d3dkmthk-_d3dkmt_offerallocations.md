# _D3DKMT_OFFERALLOCATIONS structure


## -description


Defines the video memory allocations that the driver offers for reuse. Used with the  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtofferallocations">D3DKMTOfferAllocations</a>  function.


## -struct-fields




### -field hDevice

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the device that created the allocations.


### -field pResources

[in] An array of Direct3D runtime handles to resources to offer.

If the user-mode driver uses the array specified by <b>HandleList</b> to offer a list of allocations, it must set <b>pResources</b> to <b>NULL</b>. Conversely, if the driver uses the array specified by <b>pResources</b> to offer a list of resources, it must set <b>HandleList</b> to <b>NULL</b>.


### -field HandleList

[in] An array of D3DKMT_HANDLE data types that represent kernel-mode handles to allocations to offer.

If resources were created with the <b>D3D10_DDI_BIND_PRESENT</b> flag value set in <i>pCreateResource</i>-><b>BindFlags</b>, offer the resources by their allocation handles, not by their resource handles.


### -field NumAllocations

[in] The number of items in the <b>pResources</b> or <b>HandleList</b> members, whichever is not <b>NULL</b>.


### -field Priority

[in] The priority, of type  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/ne-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_offer_priority">D3DKMT_OFFER_PRIORITY</a>, with which to offer the allocations for reuse.


### -field Flags

 
Flag options.
