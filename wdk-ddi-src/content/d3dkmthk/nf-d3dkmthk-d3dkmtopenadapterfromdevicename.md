# D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromDeviceName function

## -description

The <b>D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromDeviceName</b> function maps a device name to a graphics adapter handle and, if the adapter contains multiple monitor outputs, to one of those outputs.

## -parameters

### -param Arg1

*pData* [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_openadapterfromdevicename">D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMDEVICENAME</a> structure that describes the parameters that are required to perform the mapping.

## -returns

<b>D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromDeviceName</b> returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|STATUS_SUCCESS|The mapping was performed successfully.|
|STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER|Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect or the Windows Vista display driver model was not used.|

This function might also return other NTSTATUS values.

## -remarks

A graphics adapter corresponds to a video card. A monitor output corresponds to a head on a video card. A system with a single video card contains only one adapter. However, if the video card supports multiple heads, it supports outputting to multiple monitors.
