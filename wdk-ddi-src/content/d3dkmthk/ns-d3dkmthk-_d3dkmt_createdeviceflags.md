# _D3DKMT_CREATEDEVICEFLAGS structure


## -description

The D3DKMT_CREATEDEVICEFLAGS structure identifies the type of device context to be created in a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtcreatedevice">D3DKMTCreateDevice</a> function.

## -struct-fields

### -field LegacyMode

A UINT value that specifies whether the device should imitate several behaviors of legacy devices (that is, from Microsoft DirectDraw through Microsoft Direct3D 9.0 device types).

When legacy mode is enabled, the video memory manager does not allow the device to allocate more video memory than can fit in the combined GPU segment. Primaries are allocated in place in video memory and not preserved across mode switches. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000001).

### -field RequestVSync

A UINT value that specifies whether the device requires vertical sync to operate. If <b>RequestVSync</b> is set, the operating system will enable vertical sync on the graphics hardware until the display device is released. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000002).

### -field DisableGpuTimeout

Supported in WindowsÂ 8 and later versions.A UINT value that specifies whether the device has disabled <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/timeout-detection-and-recovery">Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR)</a>.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000004).

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the remaining 30 bits (0xFFFFFFFC) of a 32-bit value to zeros.
