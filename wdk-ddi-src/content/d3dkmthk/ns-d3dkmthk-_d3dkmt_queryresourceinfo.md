# _D3DKMT_QUERYRESOURCEINFO structure


## -description


The D3DKMT_QUERYRESOURCEINFO structure describes parameters for retrieving information about a resource.


## -struct-fields




### -field hDevice

[in] A handle to the device that the resource and allocations are associated with.


### -field hGlobalShare

[in] A handle to the shared resource to open.


### -field pPrivateRuntimeData

[in] If non-<b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a buffer that receives the runtime-private data that is supplied at create time. The OpenGL ICD should first call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtqueryresourceinfo">D3DKMTQueryResourceInfo</a> function with <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> set to <b>NULL</b> to obtain the buffer size and then call again with the correct size buffer. 


### -field PrivateRuntimeDataSize

[in/out] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> points to. If <b>pPrivateRuntimeData</b> is <b>NULL</b>, <b>PrivateRuntimeDataSize</b> is set to the size, in bytes, that is required for the buffer to store the runtime-private data.


### -field TotalPrivateDriverDataSize

[out] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that is required to hold the private driver data for all of the allocations that are associated with the resource.


### -field ResourcePrivateDriverDataSize

[out] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that is required to hold the private driver data for the resource.


### -field NumAllocations

[out] The number of allocations that are associated with the resource.
