# Pwmutil.h header


## -description


This header provides Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) helper routines for use by kernel-mode drivers. Drivers should use the function to parse and validate pin paths and extract the pin number.

To provide access to a Pulse width modulation (PWM) controller that is part of the SoC and memory-mapped to the SoC address space, you need to write a kernel-mode driver. For more information, see [PWM driver for an on-SoC PWM module](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/pulse-width-controller%20driver?branch=spb).

An app can send requests to the controller driver by sending [PWM IOCTLs requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/pulse-width-controller%20driver#pwm-ioctl-requests).
