# RxPostToWorkerThread function


## -description

<b>RxPostToWorkerThread</b> invokes a routine passed as a parameter in the context of a worker thread. Memory for the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM must be allocated by the caller.

## -parameters

### -param pMRxDeviceObject 

[in]
A pointer to the device object of the corresponding network mini-redirector driver.

### -param WorkQueueType 

[in]
The type of the work queue that represents the priority of the task. This parameter can be one of the following values:





#### CriticalWorkQueue

Insert WORK_QUEUE_ITEM into the queue from which a system thread with a real-time priority attribute will process the work item.



#### DelayedWorkQueue

Insert WORK_QUEUE_ITEM into the queue from which a system thread with a variable priority attribute will process the work item.



#### HyperCriticalWorkQueue

Insert WORK_QUEUE_ITEM into the queue from which a system thread will process the work item so that the routine to invoke is not blocked.

### -param pWorkQueueItem 

[in]
A pointer to WORK_QUEUE_ITEM.

### -param Routine 

[in]
A pointer to the routine to invoke.

### -param pContext 

[in]
A pointer to a context parameter associated with the work item to complete that is passed to the driver.

## -returns

<b>RxDispatchToWorkerThread</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success or one of the following error code on failure: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The item could not be dispatched.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

There are two common cases of dispatching operations to worker threads. The trade-off between the following two dispatching operations is time versus space (memory usage):

<ul>
<li>
When an operation is going to be repeatedly dispatched, time is conserved by allocating in advance the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM structure as part of the data structure to be dispatched. In this case, use the <b>RxPostToWorkerThread</b> routine. 

</li>
<li>
For an infrequent operation, you can conserve space by dynamically allocating and freeing memory for the work queue item when it is needed. In this case, use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/rxworkq/nf-rxworkq-rxdispatchtoworkerthread">RxDispatchToWorkerThread</a> routine. 

</li>
</ul>
The <b>RxPostToWorkerThread</b> routine invokes a routine in the context of a worker thread. The memory for the WORK_QUEUE_ITEM structure must be allocated from non-paged pool memory by the calling routine. 

The current implementation of the <b>RxPostToWorkerThread </b>routine queues work onto the same processor from which the call originated. 

If the <b>RxPostToWorkerThread </b>routine fails on a debug build, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/rxlog/nf-rxlog-_rxlog">_RxLog</a> routine is called with details of the error. If the <b>RxPostToWorkerThread </b>routine fails and WMI is enabled in the kernel, details of the error will be logged with WMI.
