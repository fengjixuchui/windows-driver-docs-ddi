# TapeClassLogicalBlockToPhysicalBlock function


## -description


The <b>TapeClassLogicalBlockToPhysicalBlock</b> routine translates a pseudological block address to a physical block address. This routine is for SCSI-1 devices.


## -parameters




### -param DensityCode [in]

Specifies the tape media density code. This routine supports tapes with the following density codes: QIC_24, QIC_120, QIC_150, QIC_525, QIC_1000, QIC_2GB, QIC_1350, and QIC_2100.


### -param LogicalBlockAddress [in]

Specifies a pseudological block address.


### -param BlockLength [in]

Specifies the logical block size, in bytes.


### -param FromBOT [in]

<b>TRUE</b> indicates that the physical block calculation should start at the beginning of the tape and account for the physical device header. <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the tape has two partitions, that the block address is on the directory partition, and therefore no physical device header needs to be factored into the calculation.


## -returns



<b>TapeClassLogicalBlockToPhysicalBlock</b> returns a structure containing the physical block address:
      

typedef struct _TAPE_PHYS_POSITION {

ULONG SeekBlockAddress;

ULONG SpaceBlockCount;

} TAPE_PHYS_POSITION, PTAPE_PHYS_POSITION;




## -remarks



A tape miniclass driver calls <b>TapeClassLogicalBlockToPhysicalBlock</b> to translate a logical block address from an application to a physical block address for a tape device. <b>TapeClassLogicalBlockToPhysicalBlock</b> is not necessary for SCSI-2 or later drivers because devices that comply with SCSI-2 or later standards support logical block addressing.

To position a tape to the physical block address returned by this routine, a tape miniclass driver issues two SCSI commands: a LOCATE command to position the tape to the <b>SeekBlockAddress</b>, and then a SPACE command to advance the tape <b>SpaceBlockCount</b>. The <b>SpaceBlockCount</b> value is necessary if the pseudological blocks on the tape are smaller than the physical blocks; in that case, the logical block boundary might not align with a physical block boundary.

If a tape miniclass driver calls this routine with an unsupported tape density code, <b>TapeClassLogicalBlockToPhysicalBlock</b> does not perform any translation. It returns the logical block address in <b>SeekBlockAddress</b> and returns zero in <b>SpaceBlockCount</b>.
