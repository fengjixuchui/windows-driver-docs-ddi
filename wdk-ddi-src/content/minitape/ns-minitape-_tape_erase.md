# _TAPE_ERASE structure (minitape.h)


## -description

The TAPE_ERASE structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddtape/ni-ntddtape-ioctl_tape_erase">IOCTL_TAPE_ERASE</a> request to erase the current tape partition.

## -struct-fields

### -field Type

Indicates the type of erasure to perform. When this member is set to TAPE_ERASE_LONG, the tape partition is overwritten with a filler pattern. When it is set to TAPE_ERASE_SHORT, an end-of-recorded-data mark is written to the current position.

### -field Immediate

Indicates that the target device should return status immediately, when set to <b>TRUE</b>. When this member is set to <b>FALSE</b>, the device should return status after the operation is complete.
