Implement this optional callback function to perform cleanup on a [**NET_FRAGMENT**](../fragment/ns-fragment-_net_fragment.md) receive buffer for which you previously specified manual fragment allocation and attachment.

## -prototype

```c++
//Declaration

EVT_NET_ADAPTER_RETURN_RX_BUFFER EvtNetAdapterReturnRxBuffer; 

// Definition

VOID EvtNetAdapterReturnRxBuffer 
(
	_In_	NETADAPTER	Adapter,
	_In_	void *		RxBufferVirtualAddress,
	_In_	void *		RxBufferReturnContext
)
{...}

typedef EVT_NET_ADAPTER_RETURN_RX_BUFFER *PFN_NET_ADAPTER_RETURN_RX_BUFFER;
```

## -parameters

### -param Adapter 
The network adapter object that the client created in a prior call to [**NetAdapterCreate**](nf-netadapter-netadaptercreate.md).

### -param RxBufferVirtualAddress 
A pointer to the virtual address of the [**NET_FRAGMENT**](../fragment/ns-fragment-_net_fragment.md) receive buffer. Cast this member to a **PNET_PACKET_FRAGMENT** to retrieve the fragment.

### -param RxBufferReturnContext 
A pointer to a driver-allocated context space structure.

## -returns
This callback function does not return a value.

## -remarks
Register your implementation of this callback function by setting the appropriate member of [**NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure and then calling [**NetAdapterSetDatapathCapabilities**](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetdatapathcapabilities.md). Client drivers typically call **NetAdapterSetDatapathCapabilities** when starting a net adapter, before calling [**NetAdapterStart**](nf-netadapter-netadapterstart.md).

This callback function is optional unless the net adapter client driver initializes its [**NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure using the [**NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_DRIVER_MANAGED**](nf-netadapter-net_adapter_rx_capabilities_init_driver_managed.md) method. By using this initialization method, the driver tells the operating system that it is managing allocation and attachment of [**NET_FRAGMENT**](../fragment/ns-fragment-_net_fragment.md) receive bufffers manually, so it must provide this callback function in this case for the operating system to invoke once the system is finished with the buffer.

### Example

In this callback function, the client driver can perform whatever cleanup or follow-up actions it needs now that the operating system has finished with this receive buffer. In the following example, the return context contains a member to track the number of indicated packets, as well as a memory object used for a lookaside buffer during receive processing. Error handling has been left out for clarity.

```c++
VOID
MyReturnRxBuffer(
	_In_	NETADAPTER	Adapter,
	_In_	PVOID		RxBufferVirtualAddress,
	_In_	PVOID		RxBufferReturnContext
)
{
	UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(Adapter);
	UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(RxBufferVirtualAddress);

	// Get the context
	PMY_RX_BUFFER_RETURN_CONTEXT context = (PMY_RX_BUFFER_RETURN_CONTEXT)RxBufferReturnContext;
	
	context->IndicatedPackets--;

	// Clean up the lookaside buffer if this is the last packet
	if(context->IndicatedPackets == 0)
	{
		WdfObjectDelete(context->LookasideBufferMemory);
	}
}
```
