Describes the link layer capabilities of the adapter.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size
The size of this structure, in bytes.
 
### -field SupportedPacketFilters
Indicates the packet filters that the adapter supports. This value is a bitwise OR of [NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPES_FLAGS](ne-netadapter-_net_packet_filter_types_flags.md)-typed flags.
 
### -field MaxMulticastListSize
The multicast address list size for the adapter.
 
### -field SupportedStatistics
The statistics that the adapter supports. This value is a bitwise OR of [NET_ADAPTER_STATISTICS_FLAGS](ne-netadapter-_net_adapter_statistics_flags.md)-typed flags.
 
### -field MaxTxLinkSpeed
The maximum transmit link speed of the adapter in bits per second. For more information, see [OID_GEN_MAX_LINK_SPEED](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-gen-max-link-speed).
 
### -field MaxRxLinkSpeed
 The maximum receive link speed of the adapter in bits per second. For more information, see [OID_GEN_MAX_LINK_SPEED](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/oid-gen-max-link-speed).

## -remarks
The client driver passes an initialized **NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_CAPABILITIES** structure as an input parameter value to [NetAdapterSetLinkLayerCapabilities](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetlinklayercapabilities.md).

Call [NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_CAPABILITIES_INIT](nf-netadapter-net_adapter_link_layer_capabilities_init.md) to initialize this structure.
