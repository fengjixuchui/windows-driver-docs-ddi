The **NET_ADAPTER_DMA_CAPABILITIES** structure describes the DMA capabilities of a net adapter.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size
The size of this structure, in bytes.
 
### -field DmaEnabler
The DMA enabler object used by the client driver to map and allocate memory. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When configuring this object with the [**WDF_DMA_ENABLER_CONFIG**](../wdfdmaenabler/ns-wdfdmaenabler-_wdf_dma_enabler_config.md) structure, client drivers must set the **WdmDmaVersionOverride** member to **3** to specify DMA version 3.
 
### -field MaximumPhysicalAddress
The maximum physical address to use when allocating memory buffers. Set this member to **0** to indicate that there is no maximum address.

### -field CacheEnabled
A [WDF_TRI_STATE](../wdftypes/ne-wdftypes-_wdf_tri_state.md) value that defines if the memory allocated should have cache enabled or not. If this member is set to **WdfDefault**, cache will be enabled only if the device is cache coherent.
 
### -field PreferredNode
The preferred NUMA node to use when allocating memory. If this member is set to **MM_ANY_NODE_OK**, NetAdapterCx will automatically determine the best node to use.

## -remarks
Call [NET_ADAPTER_DMA_CAPABILITIES_INIT](nf-netadapter-net_adapter_dma_capabilities_init.md) to initialize this structure.

This structure can be used either in the receive path, as a member of the [NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure, or in the transmit path as a member of the [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES](nf-netadapter-net_adapter_tx_capabilities_init_for_dma.md) structure.
