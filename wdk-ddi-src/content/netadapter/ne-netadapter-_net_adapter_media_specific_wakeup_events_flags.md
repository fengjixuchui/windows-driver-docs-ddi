Specifies the media-specific wake-up events that a network adapter supports.

## -enum-fields

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WLAN_WAKE_ON_NLO_DISCOVERY : 
If this flag is set, the 802.11 network adapter can generate a wake-up event if it detects a service set identifier (SSID) that was specified through a network list offload (NLO). 

For more information about NLO, see [Wi-Fi Network List Offload](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/wi-fi-network-list-offload).

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WLAN_WAKE_ON_AP_ASSOCIATION_LOST : 
If this flag is set, the 802.11 network adapter can generate a wake-up event if it disassociates with the access point (AP).

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WLAN_WAKE_ON_GTK_HANDSHAKE_ERROR : 
If this flag is set, the 802.11 network adapter can generate a wake-up event if it encounters an error during the IEEE 802.11i RSN group transient key (GTK) handshake with the AP.

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WLAN_WAKE_ON_4WAY_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST : 
If this flag is set, the 802.11 network adapter can generate a wake-up event if it receives the first frame of the IEEE 802.11i RSN 4-way handshake with the AP. This handshake is performed when the adapter authenticates with the AP.

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WWAN_WAKE_ON_REGISTER_STATE : 
If this flag is set, the mobile broadband (MB) network adapter can generate a wake-up event if its registration state to the MB Service has changed.

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WWAN_WAKE_ON_SMS_RECEIVE : 
If this flag is set, the MB network adapter can generate a wake-up event if the MB Service has to be notified about the receipt of a Short Message Service (SMS) message. The adapter generates this wake-up event either after the completion of a previously issued OID_WWAN_SMS_READ query request, or the arrival of a new class-0 (flash/alert) message from the network provider as an event notification.

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WWAN_WAKE_ON_USSD_RECEIVE : 
If this flag is set, the MB network adapter can generate a wake-up event if it receives an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) message.

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WWAN_WAKE_ON_PACKET_STATE : 
If this flag is set, the MB network adapter can generate a wake-up event when the Packet Service state of the Modem changes.

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WWAN_WAKE_ON_UICC_CHANGE : 
If this flag is set, the MB network adapter can generate a wake-up event when the UICC (SIM) is inserted or removed. 

## -remarks

The **NET_ADAPTER_MEDIA_SPECIFIC_WAKEUP_EVENTS_FLAGS** enumeration is used to specify supported media-specific wake-up events in the [NET_ADAPTER_POWER_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_power_capabilities.md) structure.

The [NET_ADAPTER_POWER_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_power_capabilities.md) structure is used as input to [NetAdapterSetPowerCapabilities](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetpowercapabilities.md).
