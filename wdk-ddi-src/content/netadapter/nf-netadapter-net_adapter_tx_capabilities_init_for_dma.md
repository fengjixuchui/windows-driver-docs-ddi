# NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_FOR_DMA function


## -description


The **NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_FOR_DMA** method initializes a [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_tx_capabilities.md) structure for a net adapter that has specified the use of DMA in its transmit data path.

## -parameters

### -param TxCapabilities

A pointer to a driver-allocated [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_tx_capabilities.md) structure.

### -param DmaCapabilities

A pointer to a driver-allocated and initialized [NET_ADAPTER_DMA_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_dma_capabilities.md) structure.

### -param MaximumNumberOfQueues

The maximum number of transmit queues that the adapter supports.

## -returns

This method does not return a value.

## -remarks

This method is one of two possible methods to call in order to initialize a [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_tx_capabilities.md) structure. Which one the client driver should call depends on whether it would like to use DMA. [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES_INIT](nf-netadapter-net_adapter_tx_capabilities_init.md) is used if the driver does not specify DMA memory mapping for its transmit buffers, and **NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_FOR_DMA** is used if it does.

Before calling **NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_FOR_DMA**, the driver must have allocated a [NET_ADAPTER_DMA_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_dma_capabilities.md) structure and initialized it with [NET_ADAPTER_DMA_CAPABILITIES_INIT](nf-netadapter-net_adapter_dma_capabilities_init.md). This DMA capabilities structure is then assigned to the **DmaCapabilities** member of the **NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES** structure.
