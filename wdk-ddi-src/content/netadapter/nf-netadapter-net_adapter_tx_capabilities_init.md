The **NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES_INIT** method initializes a [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_tx_capabilities.md) structure for a net adapter that has not specified the use of DMA in its transmit data path.

## -parameters

### -param TxCapabilities
A pointer to a driver-allocated [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_tx_capabilities.md) structure.

### -param MaximumFragmentBufferSize
The maximum fragment buffer size, in bytes, that the adapter can transmit.

### -param MaximumNumberOfQueues
The maximum number of transmit queues that the adapter supports.

## -returns
This method does not return a value.

## -remarks
This method is one of two possible methods to call in order to initialize a [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_tx_capabilities.md) structure. Which one the client driver should call depends on whether it would like to use DMA. **NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES_INIT** is used if the driver does not specify DMA memory mapping for its transmit buffers, and [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_FOR_DMA](nf-netadapter-net_adapter_tx_capabilities_init_for_dma.md) is used if it does.
