# NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_DRIVER_MANAGED function


## -description



The **NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_DRIVER_MANAGED** method initializes a [**NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure for a net adapter that would like to specify driver-managed receive buffer allocation and attachment.

## -parameters

### -param RxCapabilities
A pointer to a driver-allocated [**NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure.

### -param EvtAdapterReturnRxBuffer
A pointer to the client driver's *EVT_NET_ADAPTER_RETURN_RX_BUFFER* callback function. For more information, see the Remarks section.

### -param MaximumFragmentBufferSize
The maximum fragment buffer size, in bytes, that the adapter can receive.

### -param MaximumNumberOfQueues
The maximum number of receive queues that the adapter supports.

## -remarks
This method is one of three possible methods to call in order to initialize a [**NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure. Which one the client driver should call depends on how it would like to allocate receive buffers and if it would like to use DMA.

The client driver must call **NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_DRIVER_MANAGED** to initialize its **NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES** structure if it would like to perform manual receive buffer allocation and attachment. By calling this method, the Rx capabilities structure's **AllocationMode** member is set to **NetRxFragmentBufferAllocationModeDriver** and the **AttachmentMode** member is set to **NetRxFragmentBufferAttachmentModeDriver**. In this case, it must also provide a pointer to its *EVT_NET_ADAPTER_RETURN_RX_BUFFER* callback function in the structure for the operating system to invoke once the system has finished with the receive buffer.
