Specifies packet filters that control the types of packets the NIC completes on its receive path.

## -enum-fields

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_DIRECTED : 
The NIC should receive directed packets that contain a destination address equal to the station address of the NIC.

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_MULTICAST : 
Multicast address packets contain a destination address equal to one of the addresses in the multicast address list.

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_ALL_MULTICAST : 
All multicast address packets, not just the ones enumerated in the multicast address list.

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_BROADCAST : 
Broadcast packets.

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_SOURCE_ROUTING : 
All source routing packets. If the protocol driver sets this bit, the NDIS library attempts to act as a source routing bridge.

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_PROMISCUOUS : 
Specifies all packets regardless of whether VLAN filtering is enabled or not and whether the VLAN identifier matches or not.

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_ALL_LOCAL : 
All packets sent by installed protocols and all packets indicated by the NIC that is identified by a given *NdisBindingHandle*.

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_MAC_FRAME : 
NIC driver frames that a Token Ring NIC receives.

### -field NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPE_NO_LOCAL : 
No local packets. This prevents looping back of packets. For more info, see [Looping Back NDIS Packets](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/looping-back-ndis-packets).

## -remarks

The **NET_PACKET_FILTER_TYPES_FLAGS** enumeration is used to specify supported packet filters in the [NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_link_layer_capabilities.md) structure.

The client driver passes an initialized **NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_CAPABILITIES** structure as an input parameter value to [NetAdapterSetLinkLayerCapabilities](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetlinklayercapabilities.md).
