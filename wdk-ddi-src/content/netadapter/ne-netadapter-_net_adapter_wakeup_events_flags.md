Specifies the media-independent wake-up events that a network adapter supports.

## -enum-fields

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WAKE_ON_MEDIA_CONNECT : 
If this flag is set, the network adapter can generate a wake-up event when it becomes connected to the networking interface.

### -field NET_ADAPTER_WAKE_ON_MEDIA_DISCONNECT : 
If this flag is set, the network adapter can generate a wake-up event when it becomes disconnected to the networking interface.

## -remarks

The **NET_ADAPTER_WAKEUP_EVENTS_FLAGS** enumeration is used to specify media-independent wake-up events in the [NET_ADAPTER_POWER_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_power_capabilities.md) structure.

The client driver passes an initialized **NET_ADAPTER_POWER_CAPABILITIES** structure as an input parameter value to [NetAdapterSetPowerCapabilities](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetpowercapabilities.md).
