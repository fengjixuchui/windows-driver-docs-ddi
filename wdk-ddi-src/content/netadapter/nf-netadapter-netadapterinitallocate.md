The **NetAdapterInitAllocate** method allocates a NETADAPTER_INIT structure that a client driver uses when creating a new NETADAPTER object.

## -parameters

### -param Device

A handle to a framework device object.

## -returns

Returns a pointer to a framework-allocated NETADAPTER_INIT structure if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method returns **NULL**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a client driver receives a NETADAPTER_INIT structure from a successful call to this method, the driver must always call [**NetAdapterInitFree**](nf-netadapter-netadapterinitfree.md) to deallocate it regardless of the result of [**NetAdapterCreate**](nf-netadapter-netadaptercreate.md).

## -remarks

A client driver calls **NetAdapterInitAllocate** to obtain a NETADAPTER_INIT structure that it can pass to [**NetAdapterCreate**](nf-netadapter-netadaptercreate.md). 

After **NetAdapterInitAllocate** succeeds, client drivers can optionally call **NetAdapterInitSetXxx** methods to set further initialization attributes for the NETADAPTER. 

For a code example of creating a NETADAPTER, see [Device initialization](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/device-initialization).
