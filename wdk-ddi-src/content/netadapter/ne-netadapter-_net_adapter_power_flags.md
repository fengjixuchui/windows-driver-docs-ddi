Specifies a client driver's power capabilities.

## -enum-field

### -field NET_ADAPTER_POWER_WAKE_PACKET_INDICATION : 

Spcifies that a network adapter can save a received packet that caused the adapter to generate a wake-up event, then indicate that packet after the network adapter transitions to a full-power state.

For more information about this power management capability, see [NDIS Wake Reason Status Indications](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/ndis-wake-reason-status-indications).

### -field NET_ADAPTER_POWER_SELECTIVE_SUSPEND : 
Specifies that NetAdapterCx should suspend an idle network adapter by transitioning the adapter to a low-power state.

## -remarks

The **NET_ADAPTER_POWER_FLAGS** enumeration is used to specify power capabilities in the [NET_ADAPTER_POWER_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_power_capabilities.md) structure.

The client driver passes an initialized [NET_ADAPTER_POWER_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_power_capabilities.md) structure as an input parameter value to [NetAdapterSetPowerCapabilities](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetpowercapabilities.md).
