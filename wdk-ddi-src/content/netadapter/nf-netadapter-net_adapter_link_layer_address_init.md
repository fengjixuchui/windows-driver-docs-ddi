# NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS_INIT function


## -description



The **NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS_INIT** method initializes a link layer address.

## -parameters

### -param LinkLayerAddress
A pointer to the driver-allocated NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS to be initialized.

### -param Length
The length of the link layer address, in bytes.

### -param AddressBuffer
A pointer to the buffer containing the link layer address.

## -remarks

**NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS_INIT** is used to initialize either a permanent or current link layer address, stored in a **NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS** allocated by the driver. This **NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS** is then passed as a parameter to either the [NetAdapterSetPermanentLinkLayerAddress](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetpermanentlinklayeraddress.md) method or the [NetAdapterSetCurrentLinkLayerAddress](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetcurrentlinklayeraddress.md) method, depending on the type of address that was initialized and is being set.
