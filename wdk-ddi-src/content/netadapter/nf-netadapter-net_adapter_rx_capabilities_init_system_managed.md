The **NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_SYSTEM_MANAGED** method initializes a [NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure for a net adapter that would like to specify operating system-managed receive buffer allocation and attachment, but not the use of DMA memory mapping.

## -parameters

### -param RxCapabilities
A pointer to a driver-allocated [NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure.

### -param MaximumFragmentBufferSize
The maximum fragment buffer size, in bytes, that the adapter can receive.

### -param MaximumNumberOfQueues
The maximum number of receive queues that the adapter supports.

## -returns
This method does not return a value.

## -remarks
This method is one of three possible methods to call in order to initialize a [NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure. Which one the client driver should call depends on how it would like to allocate receive buffers and if it would like to use DMA.

The client driver must call **NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES_INIT_SYSTEM_MANAGED** to initialize its **NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES** structure if it would like the operating system to perform receive buffer allocation and attachment, but does not require DMA memory mapping. By calling this method, the Rx capabilities structure's **AllocationMode** member is set to **NetRxFragmentBufferAllocationModeSystem** and the **AttachmentMode** member is set to **NetRxFragmentBufferAttachmentModeSystem**. Because the driver does not specify DMA capabilities in this case, this method also sets the **MappingRequirement** member to **NetMemoryMappingRequirementNone**.
