# HidP_UsageListDifference function


## -description


The <b>HidP_UsageListDifference</b> routine returns the differences between two arrays of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/hid-usages">HID usages</a>.


## -parameters




### -param PreviousUsageList [in]

Pointer to a list of usages that the routine compares with the list of usages in <i>CurrentUsageList</i>.


### -param CurrentUsageList [in]

Pointer to a list of usages that the routine compares with the list of usages in <i>PreviousUsageList</i>.


### -param BreakUsageList [out]

Pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that, on return, contains a list of the usages that are in <i>PreviousUsageList</i>, but not in <i>CurrentUsageList</i>.


### -param MakeUsageList [out]

Pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that, on return, contains a list of the usages that are in <i>CurrentUsageList</i>, but not in <i>PreviousUsageList</i>.


### -param UsageListLength [in]

Specifies the length, in array elements, of the buffers provided at <i>CurrentUsageList </i>and <i>PreviousUsageList</i>.


## -returns



<b>HidP_UsageListDifference</b> returns HIDP_STATUS_SUCCESS.




## -remarks



A user-mode application or kernel-mode driver can use this routine to compare two usage lists, for example, to determine the change in button state between two usage lists returned by two <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/hdpi-h-macros">HidP_GetButtons</a> calls.

If the input usage lists have different lengths, an application or driver should set <i>UsageListLength</i> to the length of the larger list.

The routine interprets a zero usage in an input usage list as a delimiter that ends the list. Any usages after a zero in a list are not processed. Unused usages in an output list are set to zero.
