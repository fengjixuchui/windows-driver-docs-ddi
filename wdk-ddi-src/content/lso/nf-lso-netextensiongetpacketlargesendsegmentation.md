The **NetExtensionGetPacketLargeSendSegmentation** method retrieves large send offload (LSO) information for a packet.

## -parameters

### -param Extension

A pointer to a [**NET_EXTENSION**](../extension/ns-extension-_net_extension.md) structure that describes the LSO extension information for this transmit queue. 

### -param Index

The index in the packet ring for the target [**NET_PACKET**](../packet/ns-packet-_net_packet.md).

## -returns

Returns a pointer to a [**NET_PACKET_LARGE_SEND_SEGMENTATION**](../lsotypes/ns-lsotypes-_net_packet_large_send_segmentation.md) structure that holds the LSO information for this packet.

## -remarks

NIC client drivers typically query offsets for packet extensions during datapath queue creation, then store them in their queue context space so they don't have to query them too often. For an example of this, see [Transmit and receive queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/transmit-and-receive-queues). Clients can retrieve the LSO offset from the queue context to pass to **NetExtensionGetPacketLargeSendSegmentation**.

This method is a wrapper method around [**NetExtensionGetData**](../extension/nf-extension-netextensiongetdata.md).
