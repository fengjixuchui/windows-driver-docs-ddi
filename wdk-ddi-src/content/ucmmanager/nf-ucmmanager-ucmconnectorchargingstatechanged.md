## -parameters

### -param Connector 

[in]
Handle to the connector object that the client driver received in the previous call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ucmmanager/nf-ucmmanager-ucmconnectorcreate">UcmConnectorCreate</a>.

### -param ChargingState 

[in]
One of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ucmtypes/ne-ucmtypes-_ucm_charging_state">UCM_CHARGING_STATE</a>-typed flags that indicates the new charging state.

## -returns

<b>UcmConnectorChargingStateChanged</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method can return an appropriate <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values">NTSTATUS</a> value.

## -remarks

If the client driver determines that the charging state is non-optimal, it should report slow or trickle charging to UcmCx. Then, the operating system notifies the user of this condition.
