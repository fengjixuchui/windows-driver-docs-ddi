### -param Connector [in]

Handle to the connector object that the client driver received in the previous call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ucmmanager/nf-ucmmanager-ucmconnectorcreate">UcmConnectorCreate</a>.


### -param CurrentAdvertisement [in]

The new current advertisement of the connector indicated by one of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ucmtypes/ne-ucmtypes-_ucm_typec_current">UCM_TYPEC_CURRENT</a>-typed flags.


## -returns

## -remarks



When using a Type-C connector for charging, the partner connector sends a current advertisement when it's attached to the local connector. That initial advertisement is report to UcmCx  by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ucmmanager/nf-ucmmanager-ucmconnectortypecattach">UcmConnectorTypeCAttach</a>.  During the lifetime of the connection, the current level advertised by the source might change. The client driver must notify UcmCx about  that change by calling method.
