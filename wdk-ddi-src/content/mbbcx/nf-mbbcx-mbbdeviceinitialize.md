The **MbbDeviceInitialize** method registers the client driver's MBB-specific callback functions.

## -parameters

### -param Device

A handle to a framework device object the client driver obtained from a previous call to [**WdfDeviceCreate**](../wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md).

### -param Config

A pointer to a client driver-allocated and initialized [**MBB_DEVICE_CONFIG**](ns-mbbcx-_mbb_device_config.md) structure.

## -returns

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method may return an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.

This method might return failure in low resource situations.

## -remarks

The client driver must call this method after it calls [**WdfDeviceCreate**](../wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md) from within [*EVT_WDF_DRIVER_DEVICE_ADD*](../wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add.md).
