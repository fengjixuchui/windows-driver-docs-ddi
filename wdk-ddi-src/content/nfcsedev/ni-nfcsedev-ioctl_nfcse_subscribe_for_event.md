<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE</b></td>
<td>This code is returned when this IOCTL is called on a device handle with a filename other than <b>SEEvents</b>, or there is already another pending request that is not completed yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>STATUS_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED</b></td>
<td>  This code is returned when the output is non-zero, or when the GUID of the secure element does not match any of the enumerated IDs.</td>

## -remarks



The following are requirements that the driver must adhere to.<ul>
<li>This IOCTL must be called on a handle with a <b>SEEvents</b> file name; otherwise, the driver returns STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE.</li>
<li><b>GUID_NULL</b> can be specified by the client as a wild card to subscribe for a specific event from all enumerated secure elements.</li>
</ul>
