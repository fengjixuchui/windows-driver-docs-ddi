# ScsiPortCompleteRequest function


## -description

The <b>ScsiPortCompleteRequest</b> routine completes all of the active requests for the given SCSI bus, controller, or LU, including a request being processed by the calling miniport driver routine.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension 

[in]
Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension->HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportinitialize">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

### -param PathId 

[in]
Identifies the SCSI bus; SP_UNTAGGED indicates all buses controlled by the HBA.

### -param TargetId 

[in]
Identifies the target controller or device on the given buses; SP_UNTAGGED indicates all targets on the bus.

### -param Lun 

[in]
Identifies the logical unit for the given target controller or device; SP_UNTAGGED indicates all logical units for the given target controllers on the given buses.

### -param SrbStatus 

[in]
Specifies the completion status to be set in the <b>SrbStatus </b>member of each SRB.

## -returns

None

## -remarks

<b>ScsiPortCompleteRequest</b> can be called to complete outstanding requests after a bus reset, a device reset, or an abort, rather than calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportnotification">ScsiPortNotification</a> for each outstanding request individually. After calling <b>ScsiPortCompleteRequest</b>, do not also call <b>ScsiPortNotification</b>.
