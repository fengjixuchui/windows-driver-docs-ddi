# ScsiPortGetDeviceBase function


## -description

The <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> routine returns a mapped, logical base address that can be used to communicate with an HBA. Every miniport driver must pass mapped, logical access range addresses to the <b>ScsiPort..Port</b><i>Xxx</i> and <b>ScsiPort..Register</b><i>Xxx</i> routines to communicate with its HBA(s).
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension 

[in]
Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension->HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportinitialize">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

### -param BusType 

[in]
Specifies the interface type of the I/O bus on which the HBA is connected. The miniport driver's <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)">HwScsiFindAdapter</a> routine obtains the value for this parameter from the <b>AdapterInterfaceType</b> member of the input PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION.

### -param SystemIoBusNumber 

[in]
Specifies the system-assigned number of the I/O bus on which the HBA is connected. The <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> routine obtains the value for this parameter from the <b>SystemIoBusNumber</b> member of the input PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION.

### -param IoAddress 

[in]
Specifies the bus-relative base address of a range used by the HBA. The <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> routine obtains the value for this parameter from one of the <b>AccessRanges</b> elements in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION if the port driver supplies range-configuration information. Otherwise, this address can be a value returned by <b>ScsiPortGetBusData</b> or a miniport driver-supplied default value. Avoid using a base address of zero because its successful return status can conflict with the error status (<b>NULL</b>).

### -param NumberOfBytes 

[in]
Specifies the size in bytes of the range that the mapping should cover. The <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> routine obtains the value of this parameter from the same <b>AccessRanges</b> element as <i>IoAddress</i> if the port driver supplies range configuration information. Otherwise, this value can be returned by <b>ScsiPortGetBusData</b> or a miniport driver-supplied default. In any case, the driver must not access the hardware outside of the returned, mapped range.

### -param InIoSpace 

[in]
<b>TRUE</b> indicates the range to be mapped is in I/O space, and the miniport driver will pass mapped addresses in this range to the <b>ScsiPort...Port</b><i>Xxx</i> to communicate with the HBA. The <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> routine obtains the value of this parameter from the same <b>AccessRanges</b> element as <i>IoAddress</i>. Note that a miniport driver <i>must invert</i> the value of the <b>InMemorySpace</b> member in an ACCESS_RANGE-type element before it is passed to <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> as the <i>InIoSpace</i> argument. <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the range to be mapped is in memory space.

## -returns

<b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> returns a mapped logical base address for the given <i>IoAddress</i> if it successfully mapped the given range from <i>IoAddress</i> to <i>NumberOfBytes</i>. If a given range cannot be mapped, <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> returns <b>NULL</b>.

## -remarks

NT-based operating system platforms can have several types of I/O buses and several I/O buses of the same type. Moreover, the HAL can map I/O space to memory in some platforms.

Consequently, a miniport driver cannot use bus-relative access range addresses to communicate with its HBA. To maintain miniport driver portability across CISC- and RISC-based machines, the addresses they use to access HBAs must be translated with <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b>.

Every miniport driver must use system-space logical range addresses, mapped by <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b>, to communicate with its HBA(s). Calls to the <b>ScsiPort...Port/Register</b><i>Xxx</i> routines require these mapped, logical addresses.

<b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> can be called several times, depending on how many HBAs the miniport driver supports and how many access ranges each HBA requires. Each mapped range corresponds to a range of bus-relative device addresses specified in an ACCESS_RANGE-type element of the <b>AccessRanges</b> array.

<b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> can be called only from a miniport driver's <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)">HwScsiFindAdapter</a> routine or from HwScsiAdapterControl when the control type is <b>ScsiSetRunningConfig</b>. Calls from other miniport driver  routines will result in system failure or in incorrect operation for the caller.

Follow these guidelines for calling <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b>:

<ul>
<li>
If <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> is using a miniport driver-supplied set of default bus-relative access ranges or values returned by <b>ScsiPortGetBusData</b>, it should call <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportvalidaterange">ScsiPortValidateRange</a> before attempting to call <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b>.

</li>
<li>
If <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> determines that a particular HBA is not one that the miniport driver supports, it must call <b>ScsiPortFreeDeviceBase</b> to release the mapping(s) it set up to communicate with that HBA.

</li>
</ul>
The logical address returned by <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> should be used for all subsequent references made to the hardware but should <i>not</i> be added to any <b>AccessRanges</b> specification in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION. Miniport driver writers should make no assumptions about how many bits are used in the logical base address returned by <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b>.

<b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> uses <b>SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> to represent bus-relative addresses.


```cpp
typedef PHYSICAL_ADDRESS SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS, *PSCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS;

```

The <b>SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> type is an operating system-independent data type that SCSI miniport drivers use to represent either a physical addresses or a bus-relative address.
