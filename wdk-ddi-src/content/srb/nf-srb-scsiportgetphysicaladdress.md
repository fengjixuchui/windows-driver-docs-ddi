# ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress function


## -description


The <b>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> routine converts a given virtual address range to a physical address range for a DMA operation.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension->HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportinitialize">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device. 


### -param Srb [in]

Pointer to the SCSI request block if the <i>VirtualAddress</i> to be converted comes from that SRB's <b>DataBuffer</b> member or, possibly, from the <b>SenseInfoBuffer</b>. Otherwise, this parameter must be <b>NULL</b>.


### -param VirtualAddress [in]

Pointer to the base virtual address to be converted. If this virtual address falls within the range for an SRB-supplied <b>DataBuffer</b>, the caller also must provide the <i>Srb</i> pointer.


### -param Length [out]

Returns the number of bytes mapped, starting at the returned physical address.


## -returns



<b>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> returns the corresponding physical address for a given <i>VirtualAddress</i>. If the given address cannot be converted, it returns <b>NULL</b>.




## -remarks



Miniport drivers of bus-master HBAs call <b>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> to get mapped physical address ranges to be used during DMA operations. For example, <b>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> can be used to build a scatter/gather list for data transfers that span pages. Note that the <i>Length</i> returned can be greater than the size of the <b>DataBuffer</b> in a given SRB.

If a non-<b>NULL</b><i>Srb</i> is passed, the <i>VirtualAddress</i> either must be within the range of the <b>DataBuffer</b> of the SRB or must be a pointer from the <b>SenseInfoBuffer</b>. Otherwise, the given <i>VirtualAddress</i> must be in the miniport driver's uncached extension, the <b>SrbExtension</b>, or the<b> SenseInfoBuffer</b>.

A miniport driver can call <b>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> to translate an extension address only if that miniport driver's <b>DriverEntry</b> routine set <b>NeedPhysicalAddresses</b> to <b>TRUE</b> in the HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA when it called <b>ScsiPortInitialize</b>.

Due to constraints on some buses, such as ISA, the address returned by this routine is not guaranteed to match the address returned by an analogous outside routine (such as <b>MmGetPhysicalAddress</b>). A miniport driver should call only <b>ScsiPort</b><i>Xxx</i> routines to be portable.

<b>ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress</b> uses <b>SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> to represent physical addresses.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage="ManagedCPlusPlus"><table>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef PHYSICAL_ADDRESS SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS, *PSCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The <b>SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> type is an operating system-independent data type that SCSI miniport drivers use to represent either a physical addresses or a bus-relative address.
