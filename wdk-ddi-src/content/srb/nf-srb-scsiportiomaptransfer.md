# ScsiPortIoMapTransfer function


## -description

The <b>ScsiPortIoMapTransfer</b> routine sets up the system DMA controller for a miniport driver to transfer data through a subordinate HBA.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension 

[in]
Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension->HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportinitialize">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

### -param Srb 

[in]
Pointer to the SCSI request block for the DMA transfer.

### -param LogicalAddress 

[in]
Specifies the starting address for the transfer operation. This value can be the base address of a buffer into which or from which data is to be transferred. This value can be an offset within such a buffer.

### -param Length 

[in]
Specifies the number of bytes to be transferred.

## -returns

None

## -remarks

Only miniport drivers of HBAs that use a system DMA controller (subordinate DMA) call <b>ScsiPortIoMapTransfer</b>. This routine must be called before such a miniport driver sets up its HBA to transfer data. The range specified by the <i>LogicalAddress</i> and <i>Length</i> must be within the buffer described by the given SRB.

After the operating system-specific port driver programs the system DMA controller, it calls the miniport driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557291(v=vs.85)">HwScsiDmaStarted</a> routine. <i>HwScsiDmaStarted</i> should program the HBA to begin the data transfer. Note that an HBA can interrupt between the miniport driver's call to <b>ScsiPortIoMapTransfer</b> and the operating system-specific port driver's call to the miniport driver's <i>HwScsiDmaStarted</i> routine.
