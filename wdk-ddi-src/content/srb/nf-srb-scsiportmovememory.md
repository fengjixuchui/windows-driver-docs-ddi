# ScsiPortMoveMemory function


## -description


The <b>ScsiPortMoveMemory</b> routine copies data from one location to another.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param WriteBuffer [in]

Pointer to the destination buffer.


### -param ReadBuffer [in]

Pointer to the source buffer.


### -param Length [in]

Specifies how many bytes to transfer from <i>ReadBuffer</i> to <i>WriteBuffer</i>.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



<b>ScsiPortMoveMemory</b> can be called if a miniport driver needs to copy data from one system-allocated area to another. For example, a miniport driver might call <b>ScsiPortMoveMemory</b> to copy pertinent SRB values into the driver's SRB extension.

The (<i>ReadBuffer</i> + <i>Length</i>) can overlap the area pointed to by <i>WriteBuffer</i>. 

Each of the given buffer areas must be at least <b>sizeof</b>(<i>Length</i>).
