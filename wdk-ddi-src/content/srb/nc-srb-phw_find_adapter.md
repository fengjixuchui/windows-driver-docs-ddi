# PHW_FIND_ADAPTER callback


## -description


The PHW_FIND_ADAPTER prototype declares a routine that uses supplied configuration to determine whether a specific HBA is supported and, if it is, to return configuration information about that adapter.


## -parameters




### -param DeviceExtension [in]

Pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area.


### -param HwContext [in]

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a context value. For a description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>.


### -param BusInformation [in]

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to bus-type-specific information that the OS-specific port driver has gathered. For a complete description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>.


### -param ArgumentString [in]

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a null-terminated ASCII string that contains device information such as a base parameter or an interrupt level from the registry. For a complete description of the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>.


### -param ConfigInfo [in, out]



#####



#####



#####


### -param Again [out]

Reserved member when used by one of the Storport driver's miniport drivers. With SCSI miniport drivers this member points to a BOOLEAN variable that informs the port driver whether it should call this routine again. For more information about the meaning of this member for a SCSI miniport driver, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)">HwScsiFindAdapter</a>.


## -returns



The routine declared by this prototype must return one of the following status values:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates a supported HBA was found and that the HBA-relevant configuration information was successfully determined and set in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_ERROR</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates an HBA was found but there was error obtaining the configuration information. If possible, such an error should be logged with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportlogerror">ScsiPortLogError</a>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_BAD_CONFIG</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates the supplied configuration information was invalid for the adapter.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>SP_RETURN_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates no supported HBA was found for the supplied configuration information.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



This declaration is used by both SCSI and StorPort miniport drivers.
