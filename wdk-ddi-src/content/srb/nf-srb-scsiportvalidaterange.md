# ScsiPortValidateRange function


## -description

The <b>ScsiPortValidateRange</b> routine indicates whether the specified access range values have already been claimed in the registry by another driver.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The SCSI port driver and SCSI miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension 

[in]
Pointer to the hardware device extension. This is a per-HBA storage area that the port driver allocates and initializes on behalf of the miniport driver. Miniport drivers usually store HBA-specific information in this extension, such as the state of the HBA and the HBA's mapped access ranges. This area is available to the miniport driver in the <b>DeviceExtension->HwDeviceExtension</b> member of the HBA's device object immediately after the miniport driver calls <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportinitialize">ScsiPortInitialize</a>. The port driver frees this memory when it removes the device.

### -param BusType 

[in]
Specifies the value of the <b>AdapterInterfaceType</b> member in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure when <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> is called.

### -param SystemIoBusNumber 

[in]
Specifies the value of the <b>SystemIoBusNumber</b> member in the configuration information when <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> is called.

### -param IoAddress 

[in]
Specifies a bus-relative base address for the range of ports or device memory to be validated <i>before</i> the miniport driver's <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> routine attempts to map the access range for the adapter at that address.

### -param NumberOfBytes 

[in]
Specifies the size in bytes or number of elements in the range.

### -param InIoSpace 

[in]
Indicates when TRUE that the range is in I/O space, rather than in memory. When <b>FALSE</b>, the range is in memory space.

## -returns

<b>ScsiPortValidateRange</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the HwScsiFindAdapter routine can safely map and use the mapped range to access the adapter. <b>ScsiPortValidateRange</b> returns <b>FALSE</b> if the specified access range values have already been claimed in the registry by another driver.

## -remarks

<b>ScsiPortValidateRange </b>can be called only from a miniport driver's <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff557300(v=vs.85)">HwScsiFindAdapter</a> routine. Calls from other miniport driver routines will result in system failure or incorrect operation for the caller.

If the operating system-specific port driver initializes any <b>AccessRanges</b> element of the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure before it calls the miniport driver's <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> routine, the miniport driver must pass the supplied values to <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> and use the mapped logical addresses for the range to determine whether an HBA is one that it supports.

The port driver either fills an ACCESS_RANGE-type element with a complete description of a bus-relative address range for an adapter, or the port driver zeros all members of the element.

For input <b>AccessRanges</b> elements set with default zeros, the <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> routine can attempt to locate an adapter it supports on the given I/O bus. In these circumstances, a miniport driver usually has a set of driver-determined default addresses for its type(s) of HBA. However, a previously loaded driver might already be using an initialized adapter at one of this miniport driver's default address ranges, particularly in x86-only systems in which some devices are initialized in x86 real mode. To prevent such a device from being inadvertently reprogrammed, each miniport driver's <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> routine should call <b>ScsiPortValidateRange</b> before it maps any driver-supplied addresses with <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b> and then uses the mapped logical addresses to interrogate adapters on an I/O bus.

If <b>ScsiPortValidateRange</b> returns <b>FALSE</b>, <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> must not attempt to map the input range addresses because another driver has already claimed the range in the registry.

If <b>ScsiPortValidateRange</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>, <i>HwScsiFindAdapter</i> can safely do the following:

<ol>
<li>
Map the bus-relative range addresses to system-space logical range addresses with <b>ScsiPortGetDeviceBase</b>.

</li>
<li>
Use the mapped logical addresses with the <b>ScsiPortRead/Write</b><i>Xxx</i> to determine whether the adapter actually is an HBA that the driver supports.

</li>
</ol>
If a miniport driver uses a range successfully passed to <b>ScsiPortValidateRange</b> for an HBA it supports, that driver must invert the <i>InIoSpace</i> value when it sets the <b>RangeInMemory</b> member of an <b>AccessRanges</b> element in the PORT_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION.

<b>ScsiPortValidateRange</b> uses <b>SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> to represent bus-relative addresses.


```cpp
typedef PHYSICAL_ADDRESS SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS, *PSCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS;

```

The <b>SCSI_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> type is an operating system-independent data type that SCSI miniport drivers use to represent either a physical addresses or a bus-relative address.
