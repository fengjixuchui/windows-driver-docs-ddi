# tagSILO_COMMAND structure


## -description


This structure describes a storage silo driver command.


## -struct-fields




### -field SiloIndex


### -field Command

This member contains the 1667 command value.


### -field cbCommandBuffer

This member contains the size of the 1667 command buffer.


### -field rgbCommandBuffer


## -remarks



Together, <b>cbCommandBufferSize</b> and <b>rgbCommandBuffer</b> members indicate the raw data payload for the silo command, and are sent as-is to the device. The structure of the data in this buffer is silo-dependent. The structure is assumed to be shared knowledge between the client issuing this IOCTL and the device firmware implementation of this particular silo.
