# IOCTL_EHSTOR_DEVICE_GET_QUEUE_STATE IOCTL


## -description


The <b>IOCTL_EHSTOR_DEVICE_GET_QUEUE_STATE</b> request is sent by silo drivers and applications to determine the state of a storage device queue. IO requests in the storage device queue are held when the device is temporarily unauthorized. A storage device may become temporarily unauthorized in low power states or when there is a policy that requires locking Enhanced Storage devices such as when the user session is locked.


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

None.


### -input-buffer-length

None.


### -output-buffer

The output buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains an <b> ACT_QUEUE_STATE</b>  structure. <b>ACT_QUEUE_STATE</b> is declared in <i>ehstorioctl.h</i> as the following.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef struct tagACT_QUEUE_STATE
{
    BOOLEAN fFrozen;
} ACT_QUEUE_STATE;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>



#### -fFrozen

The freeze state of the IO request queue for a storage device. If set to TRUE, the queue is frozen and all IO requests sent to the storage device are held. Otherwise, IO requests in the device queue are processed.


### -output-buffer-length

The length of an <b> ACT_QUEUE_STATE</b>  structure.


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

One of the following values can be returned in the <b>Status</b> field.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Status Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_SUCCESS</td>
<td>The queue state was returned successfully.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</td>
<td>The output buffer length is too small.</td>
</tr>
</table>
