# _WWAN_SET_REGISTER_STATE structure


## -description


The WWAN_SET_REGISTER_STATE structure represents the command to set the MB device's registration mode
  and the network provider it should register with.


## -struct-fields




### -field ProviderId

A NULL-terminated numeric (0-9) string that represents the network provider identity.
     

For GSM-based networks, this string is a concatenation of a three-digit Mobile Country Code (MCC) and
     a two or three-digit Mobile Network Code (MNC). GSM-based carriers may have more than one MNC, and hence
     more than one 
     <b>ProviderId</b> .

For CDMA-based networks, this string is a five-digit System ID (SID). Generally, a CDMA-based carrier
     has more than one SID. Typically, the carrier has one SID for each market, which is usually divided
     geographically within a nation by regulations, such as Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) in the
     United States of America. Miniport drivers of CDMA-based devices must specify
     WWAN_CDMA_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ID if this information is not available.


### -field RegisterAction

The registration action that the miniport driver is requested to perform. If this member is set to     
     <b>WwanRegisterActionAutomatic</b>, the 
     <b>ProviderId</b> member should be ignored.


### -field WwanDataClass

A bitmap that represents the data access technologies that are preferred for a connection. For a
     detailed list of values, see the 
     <b>WwanDataClass</b> member of 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_device_caps">WWAN_DEVICE_CAPS</a>.
     

When multiple data-classes are set as preferred, miniport drivers are expected register to the
     highest available data-class technology that is currently visible. Miniport drivers should attempt to
     register the best available data-class as requested. If the device cannot register the data-class
     specified in this member, it should register the best available data-class.
