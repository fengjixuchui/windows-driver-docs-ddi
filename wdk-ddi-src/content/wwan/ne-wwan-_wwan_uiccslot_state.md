# _WWAN_UICCSLOT_STATE enumeration


## -description

The <b>WWAN_UICCSLOT_STATE</b> enumeration lists the different states of a UICC (SIM) card slot on a modem. The slot state represents a summary of both the slot state and the card state.

## -enum-fields

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateUnknown

The modem is still in the process of initializing so the SIM slot state is not deterministic.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateOffEmpty

The card slot is powered off and empty. An implementation that is unable to determine the presence of a card in a slot that is powered off reports its state as <i>Off</i>.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateOff

The card slot is powered off and a card is present.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateEmpty

The card slot is powered on but no card is present.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateNotReady

The card in the slot is not ready. In other words, it has been reset but has not finished initializing. It cannot be used at this time.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateActive

The card in the slot is available and ready to accept commands. This has no association with the SIM PIN locked state.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateError

The card in the slot is in an error state and cannot be used.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateActiveEsim

The card in the slot is an eSIM with an active profile, and it is ready to accept commands.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateActiveEsimNoProfile

The card in the slot is an eSIM with no profiles or active profiles, and it is ready to accept commands.

### -field WwanUiccSlotStateMax

The maximum value for this enumeration.

## -remarks

The set of reported states is constrained by the capability of the slot hardware. In the most restrictive case, the slot hardware may only be able to determine that a card is present when it is powered on and active; in such a case the <b>OffEmpty</b> and <b>Off</b> states will not be reported.
