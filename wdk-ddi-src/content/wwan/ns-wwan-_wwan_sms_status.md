# _WWAN_SMS_STATUS structure


## -description


The WWAN_SMS_STATUS structure represents the status of the SMS message store.


## -struct-fields




### -field uFlag

A bitmap of flags that represent the status of the message store on the MB device. The values for 
     <b>uFlag</b> are defined in the following table.
     

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_SMS_FLAG_NONE

</td>
<td>
No status to report.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_SMS_FLAG_MESSAGE_STORE_FULL

</td>
<td>
The message store is full.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
WWAN_SMS_FLAG_NEW_MESSAGE

</td>
<td>
A new, non-Class 0 (flash/alert) message has arrived.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

Miniport drivers should not set or clear any flag until a change of state occurs. For example, the
     WWAN_SMS_FLAG_MESSAGE_STORE_FULL flag must remain set until the miniport driver completely processes a
     delete message request that comes from the MB Service. Similarly, the WWAN_SMS_FLAG_NEW_MESSAGE flag
     must remain set until the miniport driver completely processes a read new message request from the MB
     Service.

Miniport drivers must send an unsolicited event to the MB Service whenever a flag is set. Miniport
     drivers do not need to send an unsolicited event when a flag is cleared (reset).


### -field MessageIndex

This is the index of the newly arrived message or the recently arrived message in case of a 
     <i>query</i> response.
     

Unique index into the message store between 1 and 
     <b>ulMaxMessageIndex</b> returned in NDIS_STATUS_WWAN_SMS_CONFIGURATION.

If the 
     <b>uFlag</b> is not set with WWAN_SMS_NEW_MESSAGE, this member must be initialized by the miniport driver
     with WWAN_MESSAGE_INDEX_NONE.
