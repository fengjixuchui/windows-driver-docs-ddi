# _WWAN_ACTIVATION_STATE enumeration


## -description

The WWAN_ACTIVATION_STATE enumeration lists the different Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context
  activation states that are supported by the MB device.

## -enum-fields

### -field WwanActivationStateUnknown

The activation state is unknown.

### -field WwanActivationStateActivated

The packet context is activated.

### -field WwanActivationStateActivating

The packet context is currently in the process of getting activated.

### -field WwanActivationStateDeactivated

The packet context is not activated.

### -field WwanActivationStateDeactivating

The packet context is currently in the process of getting deactivated.

### -field WwanActivationStateMax

The total number of PDP activation states.

## -remarks

Miniport drivers use the 
    <b>WwanActivationStateActivating</b> and 
    <b>WwanActivationStateDeactivating</b> transient states when responding to 
    <i>query</i> requests. Miniport driver should not return these states when processing 
    <i>set</i> requests. Miniport drivers must only send 
    <i>set</i> indications after they have successfully activated or deactivated a PDP context, and not
    immediately after receiving the request.
