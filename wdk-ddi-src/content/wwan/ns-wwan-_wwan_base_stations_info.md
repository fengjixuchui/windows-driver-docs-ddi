### -field GSMServingCellSize

The size, in bytes, used for the buffer containing the GSM serving cell info, which is formatted as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_gsm_serving_cell_info">WWAN_GSM_SERVING_CELL_INFO</a>.


### -field UMTSServingCellOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing the UMTS serving cell information. This member can be NULL when the technology of serving cell is not UMTS.


### -field UMTSServingCellSize

The size, in bytes, used for the buffer containing the UMTS serving cell info, which is formatted as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_umts_serving_cell_info">WWAN_UMTS_SERVING_CELL_INFO</a>.


### -field TDSCDMAServingCellOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing the TDSCDMA serving cell information. This member can be NULL when the technology of serving cell is not TDSCDMA.


### -field TDSCDMAServingCellSize

The size, in bytes, used for the buffer containing the TDSCDMA serving cell info, which is formatted as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_tdscdma_serving_cell_info">WWAN_TDSCDMA_SERVING_CELL_INFO</a>.


### -field LTEServingCellOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing the LTE serving cell information. This member can be NULL when the technology of serving cell is not LTE.


### -field LTEServingCellSize

The size, in bytes, used for the buffer containing the LTE serving cell info, which is formatted as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_lte_serving_cell_info">WWAN_LTE_SERVING_CELL_INFO</a>.


### -field GSMNmrOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing the GSM network measurement report. This member can be NULL when no GSM neighboring network is returned in the measurement report.


### -field GSMNmrSize

The size, in bytes, of the buffer containing the GSM network measurement report (NMR), which is formatted as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_gsm_nmr">WWAN_GSM_NMR</a>.


### -field UMTSMrlOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing UMTS measured results list. This member can be NULL when no UMTS neighboring network is returned in the measurement report.


### -field UMTSMrlSize

The size, in bytes, of the buffer containing the UMTS measured results list (MRL), which is formatted as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_umts_mrl">WWAN_UMTS_MRL</a>.


### -field TDSCDMAMrlOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing TDSCDMA measured results list. This member can be NULL when no TDSCDMA neighboring network is returned in the measurement report.


### -field TDSCDMAMrlSize

The size, in bytes, of the buffer containing the TDSCDMA measured results list (MRL), which is formatted as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_tdscdma_mrl">WWAN_TDSCDMA_MRL</a>.


### -field LTEMrlOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to the buffer containing LTE measured results list. This member can be NULL when no LTE neighboring network is returned in the measurement report.


### -field LTEMrlSize

The size, in bytes, of the buffer containing the LTE measured results list (MRL), which is formatted as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wwan/ns-wwan-_wwan_lte_mrl">WWAN_LTE_MRL</a>.


### -field CDMAMrlOffset
