# _WWAN_READY_STATE enumeration


## -description


The WWAN_READY_STATE enumeration lists the different device ready-states that are supported by the MB
  device.


## -enum-fields




### -field WwanReadyStateOff

The device firmware stack is OFF or has not yet completed its initialization.


### -field WwanReadyStateInitialized

The device is ready to turn on and register with the provider.


### -field WwanReadyStateSimNotInserted

The SIM card is not inserted into the device.


### -field WwanReadyStateBadSim

The SIM card inserted into the device is invalid.


### -field WwanReadyStateFailure

A general device failure has occurred.


### -field WwanReadyStateNotActivated

The subscription is not activated.


### -field WwanReadyStateDeviceLocked

The device is locked and requires PIN1 or PUK1 to unlock.
     

Note that if a device is locked because it requires a PIN type other than PIN1 or PUK1 (for example,
     a network personalization PIN), miniport drivers should report 
     <b>WwanReadyStateInitialized</b>. Though miniport drivers should return WWAN_STATUS_PIN_REQUIRED for OID
     requests which are blocked because of PIN. Subsequent OID_WWAN_PIN 
     <i>query</i> requests should return the PIN type needed to unlock the device.


### -field WwanReadyStateNoEsimProfile


### -field WwanReadyStateMax




## -remarks



For devices that use a SIM card, this enumeration indicates if the SIM card has been initialized and
    is ready for access.
