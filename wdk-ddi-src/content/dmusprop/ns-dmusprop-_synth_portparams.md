# _SYNTH_PORTPARAMS structure


## -description


The SYNTH_PORTPARAMS structure contains the configuration parameters for a DirectMusic <i>port</i>, which is a DirectMusic term for a device that sends or receives music data. (In KS terminology, a DirectMusic port does not correspond to a DMus port driver. It corresponds to a render or capture pin on a DirectMusic filter.)


## -struct-fields




### -field ValidParams

Specifies which of the SYNTH_PORTPARAMS structure members contain valid data. This member is a bitfield whose value is either zero or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flag bits:





#### SYNTH_PORTPARAMS_VOICES

The <b>Voices</b> field is valid.



#### SYNTH_PORTPARAMS_CHANNELGROUPS

The <b>ChannelGroups</b> field is valid.



#### SYNTH_PORTPARAMS_AUDIOCHANNELS

The <b>AudioChannels</b> field is valid.



#### SYNTH_PORTPARAMS_SAMPLERATE

The <b>SampleRate</b> field is valid.



#### SYNTH_PORTPARAMS_EFFECT

The <b>EffectsFlags</b> flag is valid.



#### SYNTH_PORTPARAMS_SHARE

The <b>Share</b> field is valid.


### -field Voices

Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous voices that the application wishes to play on this port.


### -field ChannelGroups

Specifies the number of channel groups requested for this port. Each channel group contains 16 channels.


### -field AudioChannels

Specifies the number of audio channels.


### -field SampleRate

Specifies the number of samples per second for the audio data produced by the port.


### -field EffectsFlags

Specifies the type of effects produced for audio output from this port. This member is a bitfield whose value is either zero or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following flag bits:





#### SYNTH_EFFECT_REVERB

Reverb is enabled.



#### SYNTH_EFFECT_CHORUS

Chorus effect is enabled.



#### SYNTH_EFFECT_DELAY

Delay effect is enabled.

If no effects are enabled, this member is set to SYNTH_EFFECT_NONE, which is zero.


### -field Share

Specifies whether the port's channel groups are shared. When this member is <b>TRUE</b>, all ports use the channel groups assigned to this port. When this member is <b>FALSE</b>, the port is opened in exclusive mode and the use of the same channel groups by other ports is not allowed.


## -remarks



A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff537405(v=vs.85)">KSPROPERTY_SYNTH_PORTPARAMETERS</a> get-property request uses the SYNTH_PORTPARAMS structure for both its property descriptor and its property value.
