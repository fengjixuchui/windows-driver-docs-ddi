# _NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_SCALING_INDIRECTION_ENTRIES structure

## -description


The **NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_SCALING_INDIRECTION_ENTRIES** structure represents a series of move operations for all entries in the receive side scaling (RSS) indirection table. 

## -struct-fields

### -field Entries
An array of [**NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_SCALING_INDIRECTION_ENTRY**](ns-netreceivescaling-_net_adapter_receive_scaling_indirection_entry.md) structures, each representing a move for an entry in the indirection table.

### -field Length
The length, in bytes, of **Entries**.

## -remarks
NetAdapterCx passes a pointer to this structure as input to a NIC client driver's *[EvtNetAdapterReceiveScalingSetIndirectionEntries](nc-netreceivescaling-evt_net_adapter_receive_scaling_set_indirection_entries.md)* event callback function.
