## -description


The **NetAdapterSetReceiveScalingCapabilities** method sets a net adapter's receive side scaling (RSS) capabilities.

## -parameters

### -param Adapter
The **NETADAPTER** object the driver obtained in a previous call to [NetAdapterCreate](../netadapter/nf-netadapter-netadaptercreate.md).

### -param Capabilities
A pointer to a driver-allocated and initialized [NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_SCALING_CAPABILITIES](ns-netreceivescaling-_net_adapter_receive_scaling_capabilities.md) structure.

## -remarks

The client driver must call this method when starting a net adapter, before calling [**NetAdapterStart**](../netadapter/nf-netadapter-netadapterstart.md).
