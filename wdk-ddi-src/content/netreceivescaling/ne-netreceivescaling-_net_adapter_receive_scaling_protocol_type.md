# _NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_SCALING_PROTOCOL_TYPE enumeration

## -description


The **NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_SCALING_PROTOCOL_TYPE** enumeration specifies the portion of received network data that an RSS-capable NIC must use to calculate an RSS hash value.

## -enum-fields

### -field NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeNone : 
Unused for RSS-capable NIC client drivers.

### -field NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeIPv4 : 
Indicates that the hardware can calculate hashes for IPv4 packets.

### -field NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeIPv4Options : 
Indicates that the hardware understands IPv4 options. This constant requires that **NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeIPv4** is set.

### -field NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeIPv6 : 
Indicates that the hardware can calculate hashes for IPv6 packets.

### -field NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeIPv6Extensions : 
Indicates that the hardware understands IPv6 extension headers. This constant requires that **NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeIPv6** is set.

### -field NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeTcp : 
Indicates that the hardware supports 4-tuple TCP header hash calculation.

### -field NetAdapterReceiveScalingProtocolTypeUdp : 
Indicates that the hardware supports 4-tuple UDP header hash calculation.

## -remarks
The **ReceiveScalingProtocolTypes** member of the [NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_SCALING_CAPABILITIES](ns-netreceivescaling-_net_adapter_receive_scaling_capabilities.md) structure is a bitwise OR of **NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_SCALING_PROTOCOL_TYPE** constants. NIC client drivers can OR multiple values together to indicate which protocol types they support for RSS.
