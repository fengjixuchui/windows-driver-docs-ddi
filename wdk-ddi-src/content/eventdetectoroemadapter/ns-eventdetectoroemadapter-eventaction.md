# EVENTACTION structure

## -description

Structure used to provide detail from ParseDetectionResults.

## -struct-fields

### -field EventdActionType

Actions to take on a detection. This is a value from the [EventActionType](ne-eventdetectoroemadapter-eventactiontype.md) enumeration.  
  
### -field EventActionContextType

The types of context associated with an action. This is a value from the [EventActionContextType](ne-eventdetectoroemadapter-eventactioncontexttype.md) enumeration.

### -field Confidence

The confidence level is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that represents how confident the algorithm is that the keyword was detected.

### -field Scale

The scale as defined in the [EVENTACTIONSCALE](ne-eventdetectoroemadapter-eventactionscale.md) enumeration. The scale defines the quality associated with a specific detection can be used for telemetry when no confidence is available or confidence is confusing to report.

### -field ErrorCode
 
An HRESULT error code from ParseDetectionResults.  

## -remarks

This structure is the part of the Event Detector OEM interface to be used for hardware keyword spotters. For more information, see [Voice Activation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/voice-activation).
