# FltInitializePushLock function


## -description


The <b>FltInitializePushLock</b> routine initializes a push lock variable.


## -parameters




### -param PushLock [out]

Pointer to the caller-supplied storage, which must be at least the value of <b>sizeof(</b>EX_PUSH_LOCK<b>)</b>, for the push lock variable to be initialized. The storage must be 4-byte aligned on 32-bit platforms, and 8-byte aligned on 64-bit platforms.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



Push locks are similar to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/eresource-structures">ERESOURCE structures</a> (also called "resources") in the following ways: 

<ul>
<li>
Push locks can be used for synchronization by a set of threads. 

</li>
<li>
Push locks can be acquired for shared or exclusive access. 

</li>
<li>
Although the caller provides the storage for the push lock variable, the EX_PUSH_LOCK structure is opaque: that is, its members are reserved for system use. 

</li>
</ul>
Push locks offer the following advantages over ERESOURCE structures: 

<ul>
<li>
When push locks are mostly acquired for shared access, they are more efficient than ERESOURCE structures. 

</li>
<li>
The storage for push locks can be allocated from paged or nonpaged pool. ERESOURCE structures must be allocated only from nonpaged pool. 

</li>
<li>
EX_PUSH_LOCK structures are much smaller than ERESOURCE structures. 

</li>
</ul>
Push locks have the following disadvantages when compared with ERESOURCE structures: 

<ul>
<li>
The algorithm for granting exclusive access is not fair to all threads. If there is a high level of exclusive-lock contention, there is no guarantee about the order in which threads will be granted exclusive access. 

</li>
<li>
There are no support routines for determining the current owner of a push lock. (Users of ERESOURCE structures can call routines such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-exisresourceacquiredexclusivelite">ExIsResourceAcquiredExclusiveLite</a> to determine whether the current thread has exclusive access to the resource.) 

</li>
<li>
Push locks cannot be acquired recursively.

</li>
</ul>
To acquire a push lock for exclusive access, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltacquirepushlockexclusive">FltAcquirePushLockExclusive</a>. 

To acquire a push lock for shared access, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltacquirepushlockshared">FltAcquirePushLockShared</a>. 

To release a push lock, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltreleasepushlock">FltReleasePushLock</a>. 

To delete a push lock, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltdeletepushlock">FltDeletePushLock</a>.
