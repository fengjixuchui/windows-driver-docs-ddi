# _IRB_REQ_ISOCH_TALK structure


## -description

This structure contains the field necessary to carry out a IsochTalk request.

## -struct-fields

### -field hResource

Specifies the resource handle to use for this operation. Resources are acquired through the REQUEST_ISOCH_ALLOCATE_RESOURCES request.

### -field fulFlags

Reserved. Drivers should set this to zero.

### -field StartTime

Specifies the cycle time to begin operation. This member is used only if the driver specified the RESOURCE_SYNCH_ON_TIME flag when it allocated the resource handle passed in <b>u.IsochTalk.hResource</b>. (The timing resolution is per isochronous cycle, so the <b>CycleOffset</b> member of <b>StartTime</b> is not used.)

## -remarks

Talking on a channel may begin immediately, or it may be synchronized to an event. If the driver set the RESOURCE_SYNCH_ON_TIME flag on the REQUEST_ISOCH_ALLOCATE_RESOURCES request that returned the resource handle, then the write operation begins on the specified cycle count. Additional synchronization options can be set for each buffer in the ISOCH_DESCRIPTOR structure.

If successful, the request returns a STATUS_SUCCESS value. The call returns immediately, and does not wait for any synchronization events. The bus driver calls the callback the driver provides in ISOCH_DESCRIPTOR to signal that it has finished processing an attached buffer.
