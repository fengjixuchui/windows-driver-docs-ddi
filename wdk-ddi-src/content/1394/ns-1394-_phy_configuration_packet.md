# _PHY_CONFIGURATION_PACKET structure


## -description


The PHY_CONFIGURATION_PACKET structure contains a raw PHY configuration packet.


## -struct-fields




### -field PCP_Phys_ID

Specifies the node address of the root. This member contains bits 0-5 of byte 0 of the packet. 


### -field PCP_Packet_ID

This member must be PHY_PACKET_ID_CONFIGURATION to indicate it is a PHY configuration packet. This member contains bits 6-7 of byte 0 of the packet. 


### -field PCP_Gap_Count

If the <b>PCP_Set_Gap_Count</b> bit is set, the PHY register gap_count field is set to this value. This member contains bits 0-5 of byte 1 of the packet. 


### -field PCP_Set_Gap_Count

If this bit is set, the PHY register gap_count field is set to <b>PCP_Gap_Count</b>. This member contains bit 6 of byte 1 of the packet. 


### -field PCP_Force_Root

If set, the caller becomes the root node. This member contains bit 7 of byte 1 of the packet. 


### -field PCP_Reserved1

Reserved. This member contains bits 0-7 of byte 2 of the packet. 


### -field PCP_Reserved2

Reserved. This member contains bits 0-7 of byte 3 of the packet. 


### -field PCP_Inverse

Specifies the logical inverse of the first quadlet of the packet. 


## -remarks



For an explanation of the function of the PHY configuration packet, see the IEEE 1394 specification.
