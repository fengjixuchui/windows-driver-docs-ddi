### -field nAddressesToFree

Specifies the number of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/1394/ns-1394-_address_range">ADDRESS_RANGE</a> structures pointed to by <b>IRB.u.FreeAddressRange.p1394AddressRange</b>


### -field p1394AddressRange

Specifies a pointer to an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/1394/ns-1394-_address_range">ADDRESS_RANGE</a> data structures to be released. These address ranges were returned in a prior successful call to <b>AllocateAddressRange</b>.


### -field pAddressRange

Points to the handle that was previously received in <b>IRB.u.AllocateAddressRange.hAddressRange</b> in the  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537632">REQUEST_ALLOCATE_ADDRESS_RANGE</a> request.


### -field DeviceExtension

Points to the device extension associated with the device object. Not setting this member can lead to unexpected behavior when the driver tries to access the allocated address space.
