# _SELF_ID_MORE structure


## -description


The SELF_ID_MORE structure contains a raw packet one, two, or three self-ID packet. See the IEEE 1394 specification for details.


## -struct-fields




### -field SID_Phys_ID

Specifies the device node number. This member specifies bits 0-10 of the node address. This member contains bits 0-5 of byte 0 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_Packet_ID

Must be PHY_PACKET_ID_SELF_ID. This member specifies bits 0-10 of the node address. This member contains bits 6-7 of byte 0 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_PortA

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

This member contains bits 0-1 of byte 1 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_Reserved2

Reserved. This member contains bits 2-3 of byte 1 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_Sequence

Specifies the packet number in sequence (the first SELF_ID_MORE packet is packet zero). This member contains bits 4-5 of byte 1 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_One

Always a 1. This member contains bit 6 of byte 1 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_PortE

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

This member specifies bits 0-1 of byte 2 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_PortD

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

This member specifies bits 2-3 of byte 2 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_PortC

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

This member contains bits 4-5 of byte 2 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_PortB

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

This member contains bits 6-7 of byte 2 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_More_Packets

One if this packet will be followed by more SELF_ID_MORE packets, zero otherwise. This member contains bit 0 of byte 3 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_Reserved3

Reserved. This member contains bit 1 of byte 3 of the self ID packet.


### -field SID_PortH

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

This member contains bits 2-3 of byte 3 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_PortG

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

This member contains bits 4-5 of byte 3 of the self ID packet. 


### -field SID_PortF

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

This member contains bits 6-7 of byte 3 of the self ID packet.


## -remarks



This structure corresponds to self ID packet 1, as described in the <i>P1394a</i> specification. Note that type 2 self ID packets are identical to type 1 packets, except that the last five fields are replaced by a reserved area. The SELF_ID_MORE structure can be used to access all of the significant information in both type 1 and type 2 self ID packets.
