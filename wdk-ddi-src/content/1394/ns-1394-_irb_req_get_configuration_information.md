# _IRB_REQ_GET_CONFIGURATION_INFORMATION structure


## -description


This structure contains the fields necessary for the 1394 bus driver to carry out a GetConfigurationInformation request.


## -struct-fields




### -field ConfigRom

Points to the buffer that the bus driver uses to store a copy of the device's configuration ROM. The configuration ROM is defined by the <i>IEEE 1394-1995 Specification</i>


### -field UnitDirectoryBufferSize

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by the <b>UnitDirectory</b> member of <b>u.GetConfigurationInformation</b>. On completion, the bus driver fills in this member with the minimum of the buffer size passed in and the number of bytes of data that were actually available. If the <b>UnitDirectoryBufferSize</b>, <b>UnitDependentDirectoryBufferSize</b>, <b>VendorLeafBufferSize</b>, and <b>ModelLeafBufferSize</b> members of <b>u.GetConfigurationInformation</b> are all zero, the bus driver fills in this member with the minimum buffer size needed to hold all the available information. 


### -field UnitDirectory

Points to where the bus driver returns the unit directory. See the <i>IEEE 1394-1995 Specification</i> for a description of the internals of the unit directory.


### -field UnitDirectoryLocation

Specifies the starting location of the unit directory.


### -field UnitDependentDirectoryBufferSize

Specifies the size of the buffer pointed to by <b>UnitDependentDirectory</b> member of <b>u.GetConfigurationInformation</b>. On completion, the bus driver fills in this member with the minimum of the buffer size passed in and the number of bytes of data that were actually available. If the <b>UnitDirectoryBufferSize</b>, <b>UnitDependentDirectoryBufferSize</b>, <b>VendorLeafBufferSize</b>, and <b>ModelLeafBufferSize</b> members of <b>u.GetConfigurationInformation</b> are all zero, the bus driver fills in this member with the minimum buffer size needed to hold all the information.


### -field UnitDependentDirectory

Points to a buffer that receives the unit dependent directory, as defined by the <i>IEEE 1394-1995 Specification</i>. See the <i>IEEE 1394-1995 Specification</i> for a description of the internals of the unit directory.


### -field UnitDependentDirectoryLocation

 The Unit Dependent Directory location for this device.  Only the lower 48 bits are valid in this <b>IO_ADDRESS</b>.


### -field VendorLeafBufferSize

Specifies the size of the buffer pointed to by <b>VendorLeaf</b> member of <b>u.GetConfigurationInformation</b>. On completion, the bus driver fills in this member with the minimum of the buffer size passed in and the number of bytes of data that were actually available. If the <b>UnitDirectoryBufferSize</b>, <b>UnitDependentDirectoryBufferSize</b>, <b>VendorLeafBufferSize</b>, and <b>ModelLeafBufferSize</b> members of <b>u.GetConfigurationInformation</b> are all zero, the bus driver fills in this member with the minimum buffer size needed to hold all the information. 


### -field VendorLeaf

Points to a buffer to receive the vendor leaf TEXTUAL_LEAF structure, which describes the device vendor.


### -field ModelLeafBufferSize

Specifies the size of the buffer pointed to by <b>ModelLeaf</b> member of <b>u.GetConfigurationInformation</b>. On completion, the bus driver fills in this member with the minimum of the buffer size passed in and the number of bytes of data that were actually available. If the <b>UnitDirectoryBufferSize</b>, <b>UnitDependentDirectoryBufferSize</b>, <b>VendorLeafBufferSize</b>, and <b>ModelLeafBufferSize</b> members of <b>u.GetConfigurationInformation</b> are all zero, the bus driver fills in this member with the minimum buffer size needed to hold all the information. 


### -field ModelLeaf

Points to a buffer to receive the model leaf TEXTUAL_LEAF structure, which describes the device model type.
