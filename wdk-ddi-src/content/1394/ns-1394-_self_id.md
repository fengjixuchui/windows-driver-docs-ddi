# _SELF_ID structure


## -description


The SELF_ID structure contains a raw packet zero self-ID packet. See the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8729">IEEE 1394 Trade Association specification</a> website for details.


## -struct-fields




### -field SID_Phys_ID

Specifies the device node number. This member contains bits 0-5 of byte 0 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Packet_ID

Must be PHY_PACKET_ID_SELF_ID. This member contains bits 6-7 of byte 0 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Gap_Count

Specifies the current value of the node's PHY_CONFIGURATION register's gap_count member. This member contains bits 0-5 of byte 1 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Link_Active

One if the device's link and transaction layers are active, zero otherwise. This member contains bit 6 of byte 1 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Zero

Always zero. This member contains bit 7 of byte 1 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Power_Class

The possible power classes are:

POWER_CLASS_NOT_NEED_NOT_REPEAT

POWER_CLASS_SELF_POWER_PROVIDE_15W

POWER_CLASS_SELF_POWER_PROVIDE_30W

POWER_CLASS_SELF_POWER_PROVIDE_45W

POWER_CLASS_MAYBE_POWERED_UPTO_1W

POWER_CLASS_IS_POWERED_UPTO_1W_NEEDS_2W

POWER_CLASS_IS_POWERED_UPTO_1W_NEEDS_5W

POWER_CLASS_IS_POWERED_UPTO_1W_NEEDS_9W

This member contains bits 0-2 of byte 2 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Contender

One if this node is a contender for bus or isochronous resource manager, zero otherwise. This member contains bit 3 of byte 2 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Delay

Currently always zero. This member contains bits 4-5 of byte 2 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Speed

Specifies the maximum data transfer rate that is supported by the node. This member must have one of the values specified in the following table.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Speed</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
0

</td>
<td>
S100 speed

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
1

</td>
<td>
S200 speed

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
2

</td>
<td>
S400 speed

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
3

</td>
<td>
Reserved (generally treated as S400/S800 speed)

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field SID_More_Packets

One if this packet will be followed by SELF_ID_MORE packets, zero otherwise. This member contains bit 0 of byte 3 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Initiated_Rst

One if this node initiated the most recent bus reset, zero otherwise. This member contains bit 1 of byte 3 of the self-ID packet. 


### -field SID_Port3

Byte 3 - Bits 2-3


### -field SID_Port2

Byte 3 - Bits 4-5


### -field SID_Port1

Specifies port status. Possible values are:

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_CHILD

SELF_ID_CONNECTED_TO_PARENT

SELF_ID_NOT_CONNECTED

SELF_ID_NOT_PRESENT

Member <b>SID_Port1</b> contains bits 2-3 of byte 3 of the self-ID packet. Member <b>SID_Port2</b> contains bits 4-5 of byte 3 of the self-ID packet. Member <b>SID_Port3</b> contains bits 6-7 of byte 3 of the self-ID packet. 


## -remarks



This structure corresponds to self ID packet 0, as described in the <i>P1394a</i> specification.
