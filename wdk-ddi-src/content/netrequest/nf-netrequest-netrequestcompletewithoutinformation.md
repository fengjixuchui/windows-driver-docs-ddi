# NetRequestCompleteWithoutInformation function


## -description



Completes a NETREQUEST and supplies a completion status.

## -parameters

### -param Request
A handle to a network request object that represents the control (OID) request that is being completed.

### -param CompletionStatus
An NTSTATUS value that represents the completion status of the request. Valid status values include, but are not limited to, the following:

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| STATUS_SUCCESS | The driver successfully completed the request. |
| STATUS_CANCELLED | The driver canceled the request. |
| STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL | The driver encountered an error while processing the request. |

## -remarks
Typically, the client driver calls **NetRequestCompleteWithoutInformation** from one of its control request handler routines. Call this function when completing a request that does not require additional memory transfer. For more info, see [Handling Control Requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/handling-control-requests#completing-requests).

After this method returns, the request handle is no longer valid. NetAdapterCx removes it from the NETQUEUE and deletes the NETREQUEST object.
