Sets the number of bytes needed to read or write for a control request (OID).

## -parameters

### -param Request
A handle to a network request object.

### -param BytesNeeded
The number of bytes to be read or written.

## -returns
This method does not return a value.

## -remarks
The client calls this routine if the I/O request fails due a smaller than expected InputOutputBuffer size. For example, to report that 8 bytes are required to support the requested OID:

```c++
status = STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL;
NetRequestSetBytesNeeded(Request, sizeof(ULONG64));
```

Depending on the request type, *BytesNeeded* may mean space required perform a read operation or a write operation. 

After calling **NetRequestSetBytesNeeded**, the client calls one of the following methods, or [NetRequestCompleteWithoutInformation](nf-netrequest-netrequestcompletewithoutinformation.md):

- [NetRequestMethodComplete](nf-netrequest-netrequestmethodcomplete.md)
- [NetRequestQueryDataComplete](nf-netrequest-netrequestquerydatacomplete.md)
- [NetRequestSetDataComplete](nf-netrequest-netrequestsetdatacomplete.md)
