Completes a set data (OID) request.

## -parameters

### -param Request
A handle to a network request object.

### -param CompletionStatus
An NTSTATUS value that represents the completion status of the request. Valid status values include, but are not limited to, the following:

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| STATUS_SUCCESS | The driver successfully completed the request. |
| STATUS_CANCELLED | The driver canceled the request. |
| STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL | The driver encountered an error while processing the request. |

### -param BytesRead
The number of bytes that the client driver read from the request buffer.

## -returns
This method does not return a value.

## -remarks
Typically, the client driver calls **NetRequestSetDataComplete** from one of its control request handler routines. For more info, see [Handling Control Requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/handling-control-requests#completing-requests).

After this method returns, the request handle is no longer valid. NetAdapterCx removes it from the NETQUEUE and deletes the NETREQUEST object.
