# _DEBUG_REGISTER_DESCRIPTION structure


## -description


The <b>DEBUG_REGISTER_DESCRIPTION</b> structure is returned by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugregisters2-getdescription">GetDescription</a> to describe a processor's register.


## -struct-fields




### -field Type

The type of value that this register holds.  The possible values are the same as for the <b>Type</b> field in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/ns-dbgeng-_debug_value">DEBUG_VALUE</a> structure.


### -field Flags

A bit field of flags for the register.  Currently, the only bit that can be set is DEBUG_REGISTER_SUB_REGISTER, which indicates that this register is a subregister.


### -field SubregMaster

The index of the register of which this register is a sub-register.  This field is only used if the DEBUG_REGISTER_SUB_REGISTER bit is set in <b>Flags</b>; otherwise, it is set to zero.


### -field SubregLength

The size, in bits, of this sub-register.  This field is only used if the DEBUG_REGISTER_SUB_REGISTER bit is set in <b>Flags</b>; otherwise, it is set to zero.


### -field SubregMask

The bit mask that converts the register specified in <b>SubregMaster</b> into this sub-register.  This field is only used if the DEBUG_REGISTER_SUB_REGISTER bit is set in <b>Flags</b>; otherwise, it is set to zero.


### -field SubregShift

The bit shift that converts the register specified in <b>SubregMaster</b> into this sub-register.  This field is only used if the DEBUG_REGISTER_SUB_REGISTER bit is set in <b>Flags</b>; otherwise, it is set to zero.


### -field Reserved0

Reserved for system use.


## -remarks



If this register is a subregister, the value of the full register can be turned into the value of the sub-register by first shifting <b>SubregShift</b> bits to the right and then combining the result with <b>SubregMask</b> using the bitwise-AND operator.  The size of the sub-register (<b>SubregLength</b>) is the number of bits set in <b>SubregMask</b>.
