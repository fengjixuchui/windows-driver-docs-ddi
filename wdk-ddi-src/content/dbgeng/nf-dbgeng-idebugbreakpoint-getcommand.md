### -param BufferSize [in]

The size, in characters, of the buffer that <i>Buffer</i> points to.

This method can also return error values.  For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/hresult-values">Return Values</a>.




## -remarks



The command string is a list of debugger commands that are separated by semicolons.  These commands are executed every time that the breakpoint is triggered.  The commands are executed before the engine informs any event callbacks that the breakpoint has been triggered.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugbreakpoint2-getparameters">GetParameters</a> method also returns the size of the breakpoint's command, <i>CommandSize</i>.

For more information about breakpoint properties, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/controlling-breakpoint-flags-and-parameters">Controlling Breakpoint Flags and Parameters</a>.
