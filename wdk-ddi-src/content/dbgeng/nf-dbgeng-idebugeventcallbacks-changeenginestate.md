## -description


The <b>ChangeEngineState</b> callback method is called by the engine when its state has changed.


## -parameters

### -param Argument [in]

Provides additional information about the change to the engine's state.  If more than one bit flag is set in the <i>Flags</i> parameter, the <i>Argument</i> parameter is not used.  Otherwise, the interpretation of the value of <i>Argument</i> depends on the value of <i>Flags</i>:





#### DEBUG_CES_CURRENT_THREAD

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the current engine thread ID or--if there is no current thread--DEBUG_ANY_ID.  For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/threads-and-processes">Threads and Processes</a>.



#### DEBUG_CES_EFFECTIVE_PROCESSOR

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the type of the effective processor.



#### DEBUG_CES_BREAKPOINTS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the breakpoint ID of the breakpoint that was changed or--if more than one breakpoint was changed--DEBUG_ANY_ID.  For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/breakpoints3">Breakpoints</a>.



#### DEBUG_CES_CODE_LEVEL

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the code interpretation level.



#### DEBUG_CES_EXECUTION_STATUS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the execution status (as described in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debug-status-xxx">DEBUG_STATUS_XXX</a> topic) possibly combined with the bit flag DEBUG_STATUS_INSIDE_WAIT. DEBUG_STATUS_INSIDE_WAIT is set when a <b>WaitForEvent</b> call is pending. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugging-session-and-execution-model">Debugging Session and Execution Model</a>.



#### DEBUG_CES_ENGINE_OPTIONS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the engine options. 



#### DEBUG_CES_LOG_FILE

The value of <i>Argument</i> is <b>TRUE</b> if the log file was opened and <b>FALSE</b> if the log file was closed.



#### DEBUG_CES_RADIX

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the default radix.



#### DEBUG_CES_EVENT_FILTERS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the index of the event filter that was changed or--if more than one event filter was changed--DEBUG_ANY_ID.



#### DEBUG_CES_PROCESS_OPTIONS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the process options for the current process.



#### DEBUG_CES_EXTENSIONS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is zero.



#### DEBUG_CES_SYSTEMS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the target ID of the target that was added or--if a target was removed--DEBUG_ANY_ID.



#### DEBUG_CES_ASSEMBLE_OPTIONS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the assemble options.



#### DEBUG_CES_EXPRESSION_SYNTAX

The value of <i>Argument</i> is the default expression syntax.



#### DEBUG_CES_TEXT_REPLACEMENTS

The value of <i>Argument</i> is DEBUG_ANY_ID.


## -returns



The return value is ignored by the engine unless it indicates a remote procedure call error; in this case the client, with which this <b>IDebugEventCallbacks</b> object is registered, is disabled.




## -remarks



This method is only called by the engine if the DEBUG_EVENT_CHANGE_ENGINE_STATE flag is set in the mask returned by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugeventcallbacks-getinterestmask">IDebugEventCallbacks::GetInterestMask</a>.
