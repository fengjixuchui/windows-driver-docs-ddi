## -remarks



The command string is a list of debugger commands that are separated by semicolons.  These commands are executed every time that the breakpoint is triggered.  The commands are executed before the engine informs any event callbacks that the breakpoint has been triggered.

If the command string includes an execution command such as <b>G (Go)</b>, this command should be the last command in the <i>Command</i> string.  If a command causes the target to resume execution, the rest of the command string is ignored.
