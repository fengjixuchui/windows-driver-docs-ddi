# _DEBUG_SYMBOL_ENTRY structure


## -description


The DEBUG_SYMBOL_ENTRY structure describes a symbol in a symbol group.


## -struct-fields




### -field ModuleBase

The base address of the module in the target's virtual address space.


### -field Offset

The location of the symbol in the target's virtual address space.


### -field Id

The symbol ID of the symbol.  If the symbol ID is not known, <b>Id</b> is DEBUG_INVALID_OFFSET.


### -field Arg64

The interpretation of <b>Arg64</b> depends on the type of the symbol.  If the value is not known, <b>Arg64</b> is zero.


### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of the symbol's value.  This might not be known or might not completely represent all of the data for a symbol.  For example, a function's code might be split among multiple regions and the size only describes one region.


### -field Flags

Symbol entry flags.  Currently, no flags are defined.


### -field TypeId

The type ID of the symbol.


### -field NameSize

The size, in characters, of the symbol's name.  If the size is not known, <b>NameSize</b> is zero.


### -field Token

The managed token of the symbol.  If the token value is not known or the symbol does not have a token, <b>Token</b> is zero.


### -field Tag

The symbol tag for the type of the symbol.  This is a value from the <b>SymTagEnum</b> enumeration.


### -field Arg32

The interpretation of <b>Arg32</b> depends on the type of the symbol.  Currently, the value of <b>Arg32</b> is the register that holds the value or a pointer to the value of the symbol. If the symbol is not held in a register, or the register is not known, <b>Arg32</b> is zero.


### -field Reserved

Set to zero.
