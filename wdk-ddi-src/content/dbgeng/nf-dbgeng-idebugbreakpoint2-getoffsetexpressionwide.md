# IDebugBreakpoint2::GetOffsetExpressionWide


## -description

The <b>GetOffsetExpressionWide</b> method returns the expression string that evaluates to the location that triggers a breakpoint.

## -parameters

### -param Buffer 

[out, optional]
The expression string that evaluates to the location on the target that triggers the breakpoint.  If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

### -param BufferSize 

[in]
The size, in characters, of the buffer that <i>Buffer </i>points to.

### -param ExpressionSize 

[out, optional]
The size, in characters, of the expression string.  If <i>ExpressionSize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

## -returns

</td>
<td width="60%">
The method was successful, but the buffer was not large enough to hold the expression string and so the string was truncated to fit.

This method can also return error values.  For more information, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/hresult-values">Return Values</a>.

## -remarks

The expression is evaluated every time that a module is loaded or unloaded.  If the debugger cannot evaluate the expression (for example, if the expression contains a symbol that cannot be interpreted), the breakpoint is flagged as deferred. (For more information about deferred breakpoints, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/controlling-breakpoint-flags-and-parameters">Controlling Breakpoint Flags and Parameters</a>.)

The <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugbreakpoint2-getparameters">GetParameters</a> method also returns the size of the expression string that specifies the location that triggers the breakpoint, <i>ExpressionSize</i>.
