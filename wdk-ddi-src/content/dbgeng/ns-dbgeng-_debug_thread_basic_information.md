# _DEBUG_THREAD_BASIC_INFORMATION structure


## -description


The DEBUG_THREAD_BASIC_INFORMATION structure describes an operating system thread.


## -struct-fields




### -field Valid

A bitset that specifies which other members of the structure contain valid information. A member of the structure is valid if the corresponding bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.

### -field ExitStatus

The exit code of the thread. If the thread is still running, <b>ExitStatus</b> is set to STILL_ACTIVE.

<b>ExitStatus</b> is only valid if the  DEBUG_TBINFO_EXIT_STATUS bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.


### -field PriorityClass

The priority class of the thread. The priority classes are defined by the <i>XXX</i>_PRIORITY_CLASS constants in WinBase.h. For more information about thread priority classes, see the Platform SDK.

<b>PriorityClass</b> is only valid if the DEBUG_TBINFO_PRIORITY_CLASS bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.


### -field Priority

The priority of the thread relative to the priority class. Some thread priorities are defined by the THREAD_PRIORITY_<i>XXX</i> constants in WinBase.h.  For more information about thread priorities,  see the Platform SDK.

<b>Priority</b> is only valid if the DEBUG_TBINFO_PRIORITY bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.


### -field CreateTime

The creation time of the thread.

<b>CreateTime</b> is only valid if the DEBUG_TBINFO_TIMES bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.


### -field ExitTime

The exit time of the thread.

<b>ExitTime</b> is only valid if the DEBUG_TBINFO_TIMES bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.


### -field KernelTime

The amount of time the thread has executed in kernel mode.

<b>KernelTime</b> is only valid if the DEBUG_TBINFO_TIMES bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.


### -field UserTime

The amount of time the thread has executed in user-mode.

<b>UserTime</b> is only valid if the DEBUG_TBINFO_TIMES bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.


### -field StartOffset

The starting address of the thread.

<b>StartOffset</b> is only valid if the DEBUG_TBINFO_START_OFFSET bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.


### -field Affinity

The thread affinity mask for the thread in a Symmetric Multiple Processor (SMP) computer. For more information about the thread affinity mask, see the Platform SDK.

<b>Affinity</b> is only valid if the DEBUG_TBINFO_AFFINITY bit flag is set in <b>Valid</b>.
