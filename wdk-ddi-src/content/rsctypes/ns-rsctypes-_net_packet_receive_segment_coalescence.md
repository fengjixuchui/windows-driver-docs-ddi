The **NET_PACKET_RECEIVE_SEGMENT_COALESCENCE** structure contains receive segment coalescence (RSC) information for a packet.

## -struct-fields

### -field CoalescedSegmentCount

The number of data segments that were coalesced.

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME

A union that contains the **TCP** member.

### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.TCP

A structure that holds the TCP RSC information.
 
### -field DUMMYUNIONNAME.TCP.RscTcpTimestampDelta

The absolute delta between the earliest and the latest TCP timestamp value seen in the sequence of coalesced segments comprising the Single Coalesced Unit (SCU).

## -remarks

Client drivers can obtain this structure for a packet by calling [**NetExtensionGetPacketReceiveSegmentCoalescence**](../rsc/nf-rsc-netextensiongetpacketreceivesegmentcoalescence.md).
