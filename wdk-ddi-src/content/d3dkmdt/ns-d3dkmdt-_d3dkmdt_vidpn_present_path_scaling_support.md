# _D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_SCALING_SUPPORT structure


## -description


The D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_SCALING_SUPPORT structure is used to indicate the types of scaling (and centering) that are supported by a particular VidPN present path.


## -struct-fields




### -field Identity

The path is capable of displaying content with no transformation.


### -field Centered

The path is capable of displaying centered content.


### -field Stretched

The path is capable of displaying scaled content.


### -field AspectRatioCenteredMax

The path is capable of scaling source content to fit the target while preserving the aspect ratio of the source.

This member is available beginning with Windows 7.


### -field Custom

The path is capable of displaying one or more scaling modes that are not described by other members of this structure.


## -remarks



The <b>ScalingSupport</b> member of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_d3dkmdt_vidpn_present_path_transformation">D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_TRANSFORMATION</a> structure is a D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_SCALING_SUPPORT structure.
