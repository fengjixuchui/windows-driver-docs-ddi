# _DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_SENSOR_DATA structure

## -description

Describes the sensor data brightness.

## -struct-fields

### -field Flags

Flags that represent the type of brightness for the sensor data.

### -field Flags.AlsReadingValid

The ALS reading is valid.

### -field Flags.ChromaticityValid

The chromaticity is valid.

### -field Flags.ColorTemperatureValid

The color temperature is valid.

### -field Flags.Reserved

Reserved.

### -field ValidSensorValues

A bitmask that represents which sensor values are valid. The valid flags may change between calls. Not all devices will support all or any of the sensor types.

### -field Size

The size of the structure. Fields for new sensor types will always be added to the end of the structure if it is revised in future updates.

### -field AlsReading

Luminance in lux, measured by an ALS sensor.

### -field Chromaticity

A [DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_SENSOR_DATA_CHROMATICITY](ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_brightness_sensor_data_chromaticity.md) structure that contains CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates from a color sensor.

### -field ColorTemperature

Color temperature in Kelvin, measured by a color sensor.
