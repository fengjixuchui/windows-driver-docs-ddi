# _DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_NIT_RANGE structure

## -description

This structure represents a linear range of supported millinit levels. If the driver has not set [DXGK_BRIGHTNESS_CAPS.NitsBrightness](ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_brightness_caps.md), then all values represent brightness level in uncalibrated thousandths of a percent. 

## -struct-fields

### -field MinimumLevelMillinit

Lowest level in this range.  Calibrated data provided to the Display Driver by OEMs should be taken with an On Pixel Ratio (OPR) percentage of 100% where each pixel is set to an RGB value of (255, 255, 255) or floating point equivalent.

### -field MaximumLevelMillinit

Highest level in this range. Can be equal to MinimumLevelMillinit to represent a range with just one level. For example, this could support a display with just one boost level. Calibrated data provided to the Display Driver by OEMs should be taken with an On Pixel Ratio (OPR) percentage of 100% where each pixel is set to an RGB value of (255, 255, 255) or floating point equivalent.

### -field StepSizeMillinit

The size of steps between valid brightness levels in the range. Minimum + StepSize * n is considered a valid level for non-negative n, where the level is equal to or below maximum. (Maximum â€“ Minimum) % StepSize should always be zero. If MinimumLevelMillinit == MaximumLevelMillinit, then this should be zero.
