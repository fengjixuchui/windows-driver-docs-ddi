# _WINBIO_CALIBRATION_INFO structure


## -description


The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winbio_ioctl/ni-winbio_ioctl-ioctl_biometric_calibrate">IOCTL_BIOMETRIC_CALIBRATE</a> IOCTL returns the WINBIO_CALIBRATION_INFO structure as output.


## -struct-fields




### -field PayloadSize

The total size of the payload.  This includes the fixed length structure and any variable data at the end.


### -field WinBioHresult

The status detail of the I/O operation.  This is where WINBIO error and information codes will be passed. The following table shows possible values for this member.

|Status value|Description|
|--- |--- |
|S_OK|The operation completed successfully.|
|HRESULT_FROM_NT(STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR)|The driver could not gather the necessary information from the device.|
|WINBIO_E_DEVICE_BUSY|The device is in the middle of a vendor-specific operation.  This should only be returned when the device cannot be reset, and the vendor-specific operation cannot be canceled.|

### -field CalibrationData

A structure of type <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winbio_ioctl/ns-winbio_ioctl-_winbio_data">WINBIO_DATA</a> that contains calibration data specific to this sensor.  This member is optional.
