# _PTP_VENDOR_DATA_OUT structure

## -description

The PTP_VENDOR_DATA_OUT structure contains information that the device sends to an application, in response to a command the application issued to the device.

## -struct-fields

### -field ResponseCode

Specifies the response code. For more information, see [ISO 15740:2013 *Photography − Electronic still picture imaging − Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) for Digital Still Photography Devices*](https://www.imaging.org/site/IST/IST/Standards/PTP_Standards.aspx).

### -field SessionId

Specifies the session ID. This member is not currently used by the PTP driver and should be set to 0.

### -field TransactionId

Specifies the transaction ID. This member is not currently used by the PTP driver and should be set to 0.

### -field Params

Is an array consisting of PTP_MAX_PARAMS (defined in *Ptpusd.h*) elements, representing the parameters of the response.

### -field VendorReadData

Is an array containing an (optional) first byte to read from the device.

## -remarks
