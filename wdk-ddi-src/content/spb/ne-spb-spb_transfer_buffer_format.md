# SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_FORMAT enumeration


## -description

The <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_FORMAT</b> enumeration specifies the format of the buffer that is described by an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/spb/ns-spb-spb_transfer_buffer">SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER</a> structure.

## -enum-fields

### -field SpbTransferBufferFormatInvalid

Reserved for use by the operating system.

### -field SpbTransferBufferFormatSimple

The transfer buffer is described by a simple user-mode or kernel-mode pointer and a length.

### -field SpbTransferBufferFormatList

The transfer buffer is described by a pointer to a list of buffers and a count of the number of buffers in the list.

### -field SpbTransferBufferFormatSimpleNonPaged

The transfer buffer is described by a simple user-mode or kernel-mode pointer and a length. The buffer resides in nonpaged memory. This format value is valid only if the client that originates the I/O request is a kernel-mode driver.

### -field SpbTransferBufferFormatMdl

The transfer buffer is described by a pointer to an MDL. This format value is valid only if the client that originates the I/O request is a kernel-mode driver.

### -field SpbTransferBufferFormatMax

Reserved for use by the operating system.

## -remarks

The <b>Format</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/spb/ns-spb-spb_transfer_buffer">SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER</a> structure is an <b>SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_FORMAT</b> enumeration value.
