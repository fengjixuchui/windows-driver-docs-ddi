## -description

<p class="CCE_Message">[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.]

Defines values to indicate the type I/O control request.

## -enum-fields

### -field IOCTL_SPB_LOCK_CONTROLLER

The <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls">IOCTL_SPB_LOCK_CONTROLLER</a> control code is used by a client (peripheral driver) to lock the SPB controller. While the controller is locked, the client has exclusive use of the bus to access the specified target device for the lock.

### -field IOCTL_SPB_UNLOCK_CONTROLLER

The <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls">IOCTL_SPB_UNLOCK_CONTROLLER</a> I/O control code is used by a client (peripheral driver) to unlock the SPB controller. The client previously locked the controller to gain exclusive use of the bus to access a target device on the bus.

### -field IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE

The <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls">IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE</a> I/O control code enables a client (peripheral driver) of the SPB controller driver to perform a sequence of transfers (reads and writes) as a single, atomic operation with one I/O request. The designated device on the bus is the target for all transfers in the sequence.

### -field IOCTL_SPB_LOCK_CONNECTION

The <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls">IOCTL_SPB_LOCK_CONNECTION</a> control code is used by a client (peripheral driver) to acquire the connection lock on an SPB-connected target device that is shared with another client. While a client holds the connection lock,  this client has exclusive access to the device.

### -field IOCTL_SPB_UNLOCK_CONNECTION

The <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls">IOCTL_SPB_UNLOCK_CONNECTION</a> I/O control code is used by a client (peripheral driver) to release the connection lock on an SPB-connected target device that is shared with another client. The client previously sent an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/jj819324">IOCTL_SPB_LOCK_CONNECTION</a> request to acquire exclusive access to the device.

### -field IOCTL_SPB_FULL_DUPLEX

The <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls">IOCTL_SPB_FULL_DUPLEX</a> control code is used by a client (peripheral driver) to request a full-duplex I/O operation. Full-duplex I/O operations are supported by controllers for buses such as SPI that can simultaneously read and write data.
