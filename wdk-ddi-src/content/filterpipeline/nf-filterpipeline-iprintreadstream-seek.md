# IPrintReadStream::Seek


## -description


The <code>Seek</code> method changes the seek pointer to a new location in the stream.


## -parameters




### -param dlibMove [in]

The displacement that is added to the location that <i>dwOrigin</i> specifies.


### -param dwOrigin [in]

The origin for the displacement that <i>dlibMove</i> specifies. The origin can be the beginning of the file (STREAM_SEEK_SET), the current seek pointer (STREAM_SEEK_CUR), or the end of the file (STREAM_SEEK_END). 


### -param plibNewPosition [out]

A pointer to the location where <code>Seek</code> writes the value of the new seek pointer from the beginning of the stream. 


## -returns



<code>Seek</code> returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value.




## -remarks



The <code>Seek</code> method might block, for example, if seeking to the end of the stream.

This method is similar to the <b>IStream::Seek</b> and <b>SetFilePointerEx</b> methods. For more information about these methods, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
