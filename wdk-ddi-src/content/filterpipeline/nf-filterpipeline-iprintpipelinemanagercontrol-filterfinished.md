# IPrintPipelineManagerControl::FilterFinished


## -description

The <code>FilterFinished</code> method reports that a filter is finished processing.

## -returns

<code>FilterFinished</code> returns an <b>HRESULT</b>.

## -remarks

The filter does not need to call the <code>FilterFinished</code> method. The filter pipeline assumes the filter has finished when the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/filterpipeline/nf-filterpipeline-iprintpipelinefilter-startoperation">IPrintPipelineFilter::StartOperation</a> method returns. <code>FilterFinished</code> is provided for compatibility and, when called, it does nothing but returns.
