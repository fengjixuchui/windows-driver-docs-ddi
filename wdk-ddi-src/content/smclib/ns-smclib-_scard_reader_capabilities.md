### -field CLKFrequency


      A structure with the following members:


### -field CLKFrequency.Default

Contains the standard clock frequency at which the reader runs, in kilohertz, and encoded in little-endian format. For example, 3.58 MHz is encoded as 3580. This member is required. 


### -field CLKFrequency.Max

Contains the maximum clock frequency at which the reader can run, in kilohertz, and encoded in little-endian format. This member is required. 


### -field DataRate


      A structure with the following members:
     


### -field DataRate.Default

Contains the standard data rate of the reader, in units of bits per second, and encoded in little-endian format. This member is required. 


### -field DataRate.Max

Contains the maximum data rate of the reader, in units of bits per second, and encoded in little-endian format. This member is required.  


### -field MaxIFSD

Contains the maximum buffer size of the reader. This value informs the smart card at the beginning of a T=1 transmission of the maximum number of bytes that can be received in one packet. This member is required.  


### -field PowerMgmtSupport

Indicates the type of power management that the card supports. A value of zero indicates that the smart card does not support power management. 


### -field CardConfiscated

If <b>TRUE</b>, indicates that the smart card was confiscated.


### -field DataRatesSupported


      A structure with the following members:
     


### -field DataRatesSupported.List

Contains a list of data rates, in bits per second, that are supported by the reader. This member is used with the PTS request. The reader driver usually sets this member to a pointer to a static array of unsigned long values that contain the supported data rates. If the reader does not support different data rates, leave this member empty. This member is optional.


### -field DataRatesSupported.Entries

Contains the number of linked list entries in DataRatesSupported.List. This member is optional. 


### -field _DataRatesSupported


      A structure with the following members:
     


### -field CLKFrequenciesSupported


      A structure with the following members:
      
     


### -field CLKFrequenciesSupported.List

Contains a list of clock frequencies, in kilohertz, that are supported by the reader. This member is used with the PTS request. The driver usually sets this member to a pointer to a static array of unsigned long values that contain the supported clock frequencies. If the reader does not support different clock frequencies, leave this member empty. This member is optional. 


### -field CLKFrequenciesSupported.Entries

Contains the number of linked list entries of CLKFrquenciesSupported.List. This member is optional. 


### -field _CLKFrequenciesSupported


      A structure with the following members:
      
     


### -field Reserved1

Reserved for system use.


## -remarks



This structure must be maintained by the smart card reader driver.
