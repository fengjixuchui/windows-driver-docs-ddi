# _T1_DATA structure


## -description


The T1_DATA structure is used by the smart card driver library to process T1 I/O. 


## -struct-fields




### -field IFSC

 


### -field IFSD

 


### -field BytesReceived

Contains the number of bytes already received from the smart card. 


### -field BytesSent

Contains the number of bytes already sent to the smart card. 


### -field BytesToSend

Contains the total number of remaining bytes to send. 


### -field LastError

Contains the T1 error code of the last received block. 


### -field MoreData

 


### -field NAD

Contains the node address byte to send to the smart card. 


### -field OriginalState

 


### -field Resend

Contains the resend counter. 


### -field Resynch

Contains the resynch counter. 


### -field RSN

Contains the number of sent I-Blocks, as defined in the <i>ISO 7816-3 Specification</i>. 


### -field SSN

Contains the send sequence number (SSN). This member has a value of 0 or 1 as defined in the <i>ISO 7816-3 Specification</i>.


### -field State

Contains the current state of the protocol. 


### -field Wtx

Contains the waiting time extension for a T=1 transmission. If nonzero, this is a multiplier for the block waiting time. Usually, the driver will time out if the block waiting time expires. Several smart card operations require more time. The smart card answers with a waiting time extension. Therefore, the block waiting time must be multiplied with the <b>Wtx</b> value. If this value is nonzero, it applies as a waiting extension. 


### -field ReplyData

A pointer to the buffer that contains the result of the operation. 


### -field WaitForReply

If <b>TRUE</b>, execute the operation synchronously.


### -field InfBytesSent

 


### -field Reserved

 




#### - InfSize

Contains the current information field size to transmit. 


#### - PrevState

Contains the state before the error occurred. 


## -remarks



This structure must not be directly modified by a reader driver.
