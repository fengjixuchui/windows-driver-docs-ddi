# PosCxPutPendingEventMemory function


## -description

PosCxPutPendingEventMemory tries to delegate a memory object containing the 
      event data to a waiting caller. 
      If the target caller does not have a read request waiting, the new event is added to 
      the designated event queue (control or data).

## -parameters

### -param device 

[in]
A handle to a framework device object that represents the device.

### -param deviceInterfaceTag 

[in]
The device interface associated with the event.  By default, only
          file objects that have the same tag will receive this event.

### -param eventMemory 

[in]
The new event data memory object that contains both the point-of-service event header 
          and the data. PosCx will take over ownership of this passed in memory object.

### -param eventAttr 

[in]
The event attributes.

## -returns

Possible return values are:

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></td>
<td>The event was created and delegated to a waiting caller,
          or the event was discarded because there is no device owner.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>STATUS_PENDING</b></td>
<td>The event was queued because no caller is currently waiting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY</b></td>
<td>The PosCx library was not successfully initialized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Other errors</td>
<td>Other appropriate failure error codes.</td>
</tr>
</table>
