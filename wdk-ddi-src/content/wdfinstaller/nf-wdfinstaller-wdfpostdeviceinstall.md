# WdfPostDeviceInstall function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF only]</p>

The co-installer's <b>WdfPostDeviceInstall</b> function performs any operations that the co-installer might require after a non-Plug and Play (PnP) driver's installer has created the driver's kernel-mode service. 


## -parameters




### -param InfPath [in]

A pointer to a null-terminated wide-character string that contains the directory path to the driver's INF file. The driver's installer can obtain this string by calling <b>GetCurrentDirectory</b>, which is described in the Microsoft Windows SDK.


### -param InfSectionName [in, optional]

A pointer to a null-terminated wide-character string that contains the <i>Wdf-install-section</i> name in the driver's INF file. For more information about this name, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/installing-the-framework-s-co-installer">Using the KMDF Co-installer</a>. If this pointer is <b>NULL</b>, the co-installer uses <b>WdfSection</b> for the name.


## -returns



<b>WdfPostDeviceInstall</b> returns ERROR_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, the function returns one of the additional ERROR_<i>XXX</i> values that are defined in <i>Winerror.h</i>.




## -remarks



The installer for the framework-based drivers of a non-PnP device must call <b>WdfPostDeviceInstall</b> after the installer calls <b>CreateService</b>.

To obtain the address of the co-installer's <b>WdfPostDeviceInstall</b> function, the installer must call <b>GetProcAddress</b> after the installer has called <b>LoadLibrary</b> to load the co-installer.

For more information about the <b>WdfPostDeviceInstall</b> function and installers for framework-based drivers of non-PnP devices, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/installing-a-non-pnp-driver">Installing a Non-PnP Driver</a>. For more information about <b>CreateService</b>, <b>GetProcAddress</b>, and <b>LoadLibrary</b>, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.


#### Examples

For a code example that uses the <b>WdfPostDeviceInstall</b> function, see the installer for the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/sample-kmdf-drivers">NONPNP</a> sample.
