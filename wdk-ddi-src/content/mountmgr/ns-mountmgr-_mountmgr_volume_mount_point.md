# _MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT structure


## -description

The MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT structure is used in conjunction with the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mountmgr/ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_volume_mount_point_created">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT_CREATED</a> request to inform the mount manager that a volume mount point has been created.

## -struct-fields

### -field SourceVolumeNameOffset

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the name of the mount point is located.

### -field SourceVolumeNameLength

Contains the length, in bytes, of the mount point name.

### -field TargetVolumeNameOffset

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the unique (persistent) volume name of the target device is located.

### -field TargetVolumeNameLength

Contains the length, in bytes, of the target name.

## -remarks

Mount point names must contain the full path of a mount point object name in the system object tree. For example: "\DosDevices\E:\FilesysD\mnt". For an explanation of unique volume names and how the mount manager uses them, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/supporting-mount-manager-requests-in-a-storage-class-driver">Supporting Mount Manager Requests in a Storage Class Driver</a>.
