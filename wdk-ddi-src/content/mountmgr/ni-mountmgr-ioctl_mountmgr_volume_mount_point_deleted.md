# IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT_DELETED IOCTL


## -description


The mount manager clients use this IOCTL to alert the mount manager that a volume mount point has been deleted so that the mount manager can replicate the database entry for the given mount point.

The Microsoft Win32 routine <b>DeleteVolumeMountPoint</b> sends this IOCTL to the mount manager, to inform the mount manager that a directory junction is no longer pointing to a volume name. The mount manager responds by deleting the volume name formerly contained in the directory junction along with its unique ID from the volume hosting the directory junction. 


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The mount manager client initializes the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mountmgr/ns-mountmgr-_mountmgr_volume_mount_point">MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT</a> structure, defined in <i>Mountmgr.h</i>, at the beginning of the buffer at <b>Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b>.


### -input-buffer-length

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the input buffer, which must be greater than or equal to <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT).


### -output-buffer

None


### -output-buffer-length

None


### -in-out-buffer








### -inout-buffer-length








### -status-block

If the operation is successful, the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS.

If <b>InputBufferLength</b> is less than <b>sizeof</b>(MOUNTMGR_VOLUME_MOUNT_POINT), the <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
