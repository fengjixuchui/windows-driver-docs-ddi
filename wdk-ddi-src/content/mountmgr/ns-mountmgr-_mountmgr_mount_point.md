# _MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure


## -description

The MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure is used by mount manager clients in conjunction with an <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mountmgr/ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_query_points">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS</a> request to query the mount manager for all of the mount points (symbolic links) associated with a device. The mount manager responds by sending an array of MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structures containing the mount points.

## -struct-fields

### -field SymbolicLinkNameOffset

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the symbolic link is located.

### -field SymbolicLinkNameLength

Contains the length, in bytes, of the symbolic link.

### -field Reserved1

### -field UniqueIdOffset

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the unique ID is located.

### -field UniqueIdLength

Contains the length, in bytes, of the unique ID.

### -field Reserved2

### -field DeviceNameOffset

Contains an offset, in bytes, into the output buffer where the nonpersistent device name is located.

### -field DeviceNameLength

Contains the length, in bytes, of the nonpersistent device name.

### -field Reserved3

## -remarks

None of the names returned are <b>NULL</b> terminated, nor do the buffers require terminating <b>NULL</b> characters. The caller of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mountmgr/ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_query_points">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS</a> is not required to provide data in all of the members of the MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure, but empty members must have an offset of zero.

On input, offsets are from the beginning of the MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT structure. On output offsets are from the beginning of the buffer. This is usually the same as the beginning of the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mountmgr/ns-mountmgr-_mountmgr_mount_points">MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINTS</a> container structure (as opposed to the embedded MOUNTMGR_MOUNT_POINT array instance).

The <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/mountmgr/ni-mountmgr-ioctl_mountmgr_query_points">IOCTL_MOUNTMGR_QUERY_POINTS</a> request is available in Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For a discussion of the different between symbolic links, unique IDs, and nonpersistent device names, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/supporting-mount-manager-requests-in-a-storage-class-driver">Supporting Mount Manager Requests in a Storage Class Driver</a>.
