# IOCTL_MOUNTDEV_QUERY_DEVICE_NAME IOCTL

## -description

Support for this IOCTL by the mount manager clients is mandatory. Upon receiving this IOCTL a client driver must provide the (nonpersistent) device (or target) name for the volume. The mount manager uses the *device name* returned by the client as the target of a symbolic link. An example of a device name would be "\Device\HarddiskVolume1".

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

### -input-buffer-length

### -output-buffer

The mount manager client returns a variable-length structure of type [MOUNTDEV_NAME](ns-mountmgr-_mountdev_name.md), defined in *Mountmgr.h*, at the beginning of the buffer at **Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer**. The device name must be inserted at the address pointed to by the *Name* member of this structure.

### -output-buffer-length

**Parameters.DeviceIoControl.OutputBufferLength** in the I/O stack location of the IRP indicates the size, in bytes, of the output buffer, which must be greater than or equal to **sizeof**(MOUNTDEV_NAME).

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

The **Information** field is set to FIELD_OFFSET([MOUNTDEV_NAME](ns-mountmgr-_mountdev_name.md), Name) + output-\>NameLength, or alternatively, output-\>NameLength + sizeof(USHORT), where output points to the buffer at **Irp-\>AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer**

If the operation is successful, the mount manager client must set the **Information** field to the length of the **NULL**-terminated string containing the device name and the **Status** field to STATUS_SUCCESS.

If the output buffer is too small to hold the device name, the mount manager client must set the **Information** field to **sizeof**(MOUNTDEV_NAME) and the **Status** field to STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW. In addition, the mount manager client fills in the NameLength member of the [MOUNTDEV_NAME](ns-mountmgr-_mountdev_name.md) structure.

## -remarks

As a best practice, the implementer must not thread-synchronize and must not make blocking and/or Interprocess Communication (IPC) function calls.
