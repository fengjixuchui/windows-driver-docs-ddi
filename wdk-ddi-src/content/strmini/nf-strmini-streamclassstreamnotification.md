# StreamClassStreamNotification function


## -description

Streams use the <b>StreamClassStreamNotification</b> routine to notify the class driver that it has completed a stream request, or that an event has occurred.

## -parameters

### -param NotificationType 

[in]
This is an enumeration value that contains the type of notification that the minidriver is sending.





#### StreamRequestComplete

Indicates that the minidriver has completed its handling of the stream-oriented stream request block that is pointed to by the optional third argument of this routine, <i>pSrb</i>.



#### ReadyForNextStreamDataRequest

Indicates that this stream is ready to receive another data request. 



#### ReadyForNextStreamControlRequest

Indicates that this stream is ready to receive another control request. 



#### SignalStreamEvent

Signals that the event specified by the <i>EventEntry</i> parameter has occurred.



#### SignalMultipleStreamEvents

Signals that all events that match the criteria specified in the <i>EventSet</i> and <i>EventId</i> parameters have occurred.



#### DeleteStreamEvent

Deletes the event specified by the <i>EventEntry</i> parameter.

### -param StreamObject 

[in]
Points to the stream object of the stream that the class driver is being notified about.

### -param param

#### - EventEntry

Specify only if <i>NotificationType</i> equals either <b>SignalStreamEvent</b> or <b>DeleteStreamEvent</b>. Pointer to the event to be signaled or deleted. This parameter is optional. 


#### - EventId

Indicates the event ID against which to match in the event queue for this stream. Specify only if <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>SignalMultipleStreamEvents</b>. This parameter is optional.


#### - EventSet

Identifies the event set against which to match in the event queue for this stream. Specify only if <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>SignalMultipleStreamEvents</b>. This parameter is optional. 


#### - pSrb

Pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/strmini/ns-strmini-_hw_stream_request_block">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> structure. Specify only if <i>NotificationType</i> equals <b>StreamRequestComplete</b>. Pointer to the stream request block that the minidriver has completed processing. Once this routine completes, this address is no longer valid. This parameter is optional.

## -remarks

The minidriver uses this routine for requests or events that apply to the minidriver as a whole. Stream-specific requests or events use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/strmini/nf-strmini-streamclassdevicenotification">StreamClassDeviceNotification</a>.
