# PHW_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_HANDLER callback function


## -description


The stream class driver calls the minidriver's <i>StrMiniRequestTimeout</i> routine to signal to the minidriver that a request has timed out.


## -parameters




### -param SRB








#### - pSrb [in]

Pointer to the stream request that has timed out.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



The minidriver specifies this routine in the <b>HwRequestTimeoutHandler</b> member of its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/ns-strmini-_hw_initialization_data">HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA</a> structure. The minidriver passes this structure to the class driver when it registers itself by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/nf-strmini-streamclassregisteradapter">StreamClassRegisterMinidriver</a>.

When the class driver first issues a request, it sets a time-out value (in seconds) with the <b>TimeoutCounter</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/ns-strmini-_hw_stream_request_block">HW_STREAM_REQUEST_BLOCK</a> pointed to by <i>pSrb</i>. The class driver decrements the <b>TimeoutCounter</b> member of that structure once a second. A request times out when the class driver decrements <b>TimeoutCounter</b> to zero, at which time the class driver calls <i>StrMiniRequestTimeout</i> to handle any clean-up necessary to cease processing the request.

Minidrivers that rely on the class driver to handle synchronization should, once they have successfully handled the request time-out, signal to the class driver that they are ready for another request by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/nf-strmini-streamclassstreamnotification">StreamClassStreamNotification</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/nf-strmini-streamclassdevicenotification">StreamClassDeviceNotification</a> with the appropriate <b>ReadyForNext</b><i>Xxx</i><b>Request</b>.
