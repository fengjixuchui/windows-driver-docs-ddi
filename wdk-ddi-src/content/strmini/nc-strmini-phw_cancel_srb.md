# PHW_CANCEL_SRB callback function


## -description


The class driver calls the minidriver's <i>StrMiniCancelPacket</i> routine to signal that a stream request has been canceled.


## -parameters




### -param SRB








#### - pSrb [in]

Pointer to the stream request that had been canceled.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



The minidriver specifies this routine in the <b>HwCancelPacket</b> member of its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/ns-strmini-_hw_initialization_data">HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA</a> structure. The minidriver passes this structure to the class driver when it registers itself by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/nf-strmini-streamclassregisteradapter">StreamClassRegisterMinidriver</a>.

Minidrivers that rely on the class driver to handle synchronization should, once they have successfully canceled a request, signal to the class driver that they are ready for another request by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/nf-strmini-streamclassstreamnotification">StreamClassStreamNotification</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/strmini/nf-strmini-streamclassdevicenotification">StreamClassDeviceNotification</a> with the appropriate <b>ReadyForNext</b><i>Xxx</i><b>Request</b>.
