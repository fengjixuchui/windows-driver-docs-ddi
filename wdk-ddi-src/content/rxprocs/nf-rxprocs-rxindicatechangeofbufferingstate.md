# RxIndicateChangeOfBufferingState function


## -description


<b>RxIndicateChangeOfBufferingState</b> is called to register a change buffering state request (an oplock break indication, for example) for later processing. If necessary, worker thread routines for further processing are activated.


## -parameters




### -param SrvCall

A pointer to the SRV_CALL structure.


### -param SrvOpenKey

A pointer to the key for the SRV_OPEN structure.


### -param Context

<p>A pointer to the context to be passed back to the network mini-redirector during callbacks for processing the request.</p>




## -remarks



<b>RxIndicateChangeOfBufferingState</b> registers the change buffering state request by either inserting it in the registration list (DPC Level processing ) or the appropriate dispatcher/handler list.

This is an instance in which the buffering state change request from the server identifies the SRV_OPEN structure using the key generated by the server. This implies that the key needs to be mapped onto the SRV_OPEN structure locally.

The internal routines called by this routine can fail because of a lack of available memory (unable to allocate non-paged pool memory, for example), but since this is a VOID routine no error is returned when this condition occurs.

If a buffering state request can be processed immediately instead of being queued for processing later, then <b>RxChangeBufferingState</b> can be called.
