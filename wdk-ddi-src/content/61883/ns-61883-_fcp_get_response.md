# _FCP_GET_RESPONSE structure


## -description


The structure is used in a request yjsy retrieves the next FCP response from the queue of requests maintained by the IEC-61883 protocol driver. FCP requests and responses from AV devices are routed to the IEC-61883 protocol driver, which queues the requests. Client drivers send <b>Av61883_GetFcpResponse</b> to retrieve an FCP response from the queue.


## -struct-fields




### -field NodeAddress

On output, if the protocol driver is being used to control a virtual device, the protocol driver supplies the node address of the device that sent the response obtained with this <b>Av61883_GetFcpResponse</b> IRP. If the protocol driver is being used to control a physical device, <b>NodeAddress</b> is not used.


### -field Length

On input, the maximum available length, in bytes, of the frame payload, including FCP header. 

On completion, this field will contain the actual length of the response in bytes.


### -field Frame

On input a pointer to a caller-allocated <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/61883/ns-61883-_fcp_frame">FCP_FRAME</a> structure to receive the FCP response.

The FCP frame written to the caller-allocated FCP_FRAME structure by the protocol driver.


## -remarks



If successful, the IEC-61883 protocol driver sets <b>Irp->IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If the request is queued, the protocol driver sets a status of STATUS_PENDING. If the request has been previously canceled, the driver sets a status of STATUS_CANCELLED.

If an incorrect parameter is passed in, the protocol driver sets <b>Irp->IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
