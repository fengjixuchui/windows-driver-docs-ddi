# _CMP_GET_PLUG_STATE structure


## -description

This structure is used in getting the state of a plug.The  request retrieves state information for the specified plug, including its current connections and bus data format. Plug state is volatile and can change unexpectedly.

## -struct-fields

### -field hPlug

On input, the handle of the plug to retrieve state information.

### -field State

On output, the state of the plug. Can be one of the following:

CMP_PLUG_STATE_IDLE 

CMP_PLUG_STATE_READY 

CMP_PLUG_STATE_SUSPENDED 

CMP_PLUG_STATE_ACTIVE

### -field DataRate

On output, the data rate of the plug. Can be one of the following: 

CMP_SPEED_S100 

CMP_SPEED_S200 

CMP_SPEED_S400

### -field Payload

On output, the payload size for the plug.

### -field BC_Connections

On output, the number of broadcast connections associated with the plug.

### -field PP_Connections

On output, the number of point-to-point connections associated with the plug.

## -remarks

If successful, the IEC-61883 protocol driver sets <b>Irp->IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_SUCCESS. 

If an incorrect parameter is passed in, the protocol driver sets <b>Irp->IoStatus.Status </b>to STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.
