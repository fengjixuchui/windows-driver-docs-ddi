# _KSM_PIN structure


## -description

The KSM_PIN structure describes a method request to create or delete a pin factory for a filter.

## -struct-fields

### -field Method

KSMETHOD structure that describes a method and request type of a method request.

### -field PinId

Member of the union in KSM_PIN that contains the identifier (ID) of a pin factory of a filter.

### -field PinType

Member of the union in KSM_PIN that contains the value that specifies the pin type.

### -field Reserved

Reserved.

## -remarks

When the network provider creates or deletes a pin for a filter using either KSMETHOD_BDA_CREATE_PIN_FACTORY or KSMETHOD_BDA_DELETE_PIN_FACTORY of the KSMETHODSETID_BdaDeviceConfiguration method set, the BDA minidriver for the filter gives that pin an ID. The ID for the pin is returned in KSM_PIN.
