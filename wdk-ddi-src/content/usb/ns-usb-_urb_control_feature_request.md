# _URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST structure


## -description


The <b>_URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST</b> structure is used by USB client drivers  to set or clear features on a device, interface, or endpoint.


## -struct-fields




### -field Hdr

Pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/usb/ns-usb-_urb_header">_URB_HEADER</a> structure that specifies the URB header information. <b>Hdr.Function</b> indicates either a set or a clear feature operation, to perform on a device, interface, endpoint or other non-standard component. <b>Hdr.Function</b> must have one of the following values:

<b>Hdr.Length</b> must equal <code>sizeof(_URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST)</code>.


### -field Reserved

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field Reserved2

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field Reserved3

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field Reserved4

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field Reserved5

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field UrbLink

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field hca

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field Reserved0

Reserved. Do not use.


### -field FeatureSelector

Specifies the USB-defined feature code to be cleared or set. Using a feature code that is invalid, cannot be set, or cannot be cleared will cause the target to stall. The bus driver will copy the value in the <b>FeatureSelector</b> member to the <b>wValue</b> field of the setup packet. 


### -field Index

Specifies the device-defined index, returned by a successful configuration request, if the request is for an endpoint or interface. Otherwise, <b>Index</b> must be zero. The bus driver will copy the value in the <b>Index</b> member to the <b>wIndex</b> field of the setup packet. 


### -field Reserved1

Reserved. Do not use.


## -remarks



Drivers can use the <b>UsbBuildFeatureRequest</b> service routine to format this URB. 

The reserved members of this structure must be treated as opaque and are reserved for system use.

When a driver arms a USB device for remote wakeup with an IRP_MN_WAIT_WAKE request, the USB bus driver automatically sets remote wakeup feature on the device. A control feature URB is not necessary.

Likewise, when a driver issues a URB with a function type of URB_FUNCTION_SYNC_RESET_PIPE_AND_CLEAR_STALL to a pipe, the bus driver will automatically clear the pipe's endpoint stall feature. The driver does not have to send a control feature URB to the pipe to clear the endpoint stall.
