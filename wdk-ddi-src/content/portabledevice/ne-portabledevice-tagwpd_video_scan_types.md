# tagWPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPES enumeration


## -description



The <b>WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPES</b> enumeration type describes how the fields in a video file are encoded.




## -enum-fields




### -field WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_UNUSED

The scan type has not been defined for this video file, or is not applicable.


### -field WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_PROGRESSIVE

A progressive scan video file.


### -field WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_FIELD_INTERLEAVED_UPPER_FIRST

An interleaved video file where the fields alternate and the upper field (with line 1) is drawn first. For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -field WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_FIELD_INTERLEAVED_LOWER_FIRST

An interleaved video file where the fields alternate and the lower field (with line 2) is drawn first. For more information, see <b>Remarks</b>, following this section.


### -field WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_FIELD_SINGLE_UPPER_FIRST

An interleaved video file where the fields are sent as contiguous samples and the upper field (with line 1) is drawn first. For more information, see <b>Remarks</b>, following this section.


### -field WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_FIELD_SINGLE_LOWER_FIRST

An interleaved video file where the fields are sent as contiguous samples and the lower field (with line 2) is sent first.


### -field WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_MIXED_INTERLACE

A video file with a mix of interlacing modes.


### -field WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_MIXED_INTERLACE_AND_PROGRESSIVE

A video file with a mix of interlaced and progressive modes.


## -remarks



This enumeration is used by the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff597900(v=vs.85)">WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE</a> property.

There are two types of interleaved file formats that are specified by this enumeration. WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_FIELD_INTERLEAVED refers to a file format where frames are delivered as they were scanned—fields alternate and data goes line by line, as shown here:

<b>Frame 1</b>

Field 1: Line 1

Field 2: Line 1

Field 1: Line 2

Field 2: Line 2

Field 1: Line 3

Field 2: Line 3

...

WPD_VIDEO_SCAN_TYPE_FIELD_SINGLE refers to a file format where each field is stored in a single block of scan lines, and fields are stored sequentially, as shown here:

<b>Frame 1</b>

Field 1: Line 1

Field 1: Line 2

Field 1: Line 3

...

Followed by

Field 2: Line 1

Field 2: Line 2

Field 2: Line 3

...
