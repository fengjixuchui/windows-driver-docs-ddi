# _WDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS enumeration


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]</p>

The <b>WDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS</b> enumeration defines values that identify whether a driver requires a framework file object to represent a file that an application or another driver is attempting to create or open. These values also specify where the framework can store the object's handle.


## -enum-fields




### -field WdfFileObjectInvalid

Reserved for internal use.


### -field WdfFileObjectNotRequired

The driver does not require a framework file object.


### -field WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext

The driver requires a framework file object. The framework can store the object's handle in the <b>FsContext</b> member of the file's Windows Driver Model (WDM) <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_file_object">FILE_OBJECT</a> structure.


### -field WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext2

The driver requires a framework file object. The framework can store the object's handle in the <b>FsContext2</b> member of the file's WDM FILE_OBJECT structure.


### -field WdfFileObjectWdfCannotUseFsContexts

The driver requires a framework file object. The framework cannot store the object's handle in the <b>FsContext</b> or <b>FsContext2</b> member of the file's WDM FILE_OBJECT structure, because one or more drivers are using these members. Therefore, the framework must store the handle internally.


### -field WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional

The driver typically requires a framework file object, but the driver can also handle special situations in which a framework file object is missing or different. For more information about these situations, see the following Remarks section. 

<b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> is a bit flag that your driver can OR with the <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext</b>, <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext2</b>, or <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCannotUseFsContexts</b> enumerator value. 

Most framework-based drivers do not use this bit flag.

The <b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> value is available in version 1.9 and later versions of KMDF.


## -remarks



The <b>WDF_FILEOBJECT_CLASS</b> enumeration is used in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/ns-wdfdevice-_wdf_fileobject_config">WDF_FILEOBJECT_CONFIG</a> structure.

If your driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetfileobject">WdfRequestGetFileObject</a> to obtain framework file objects for I/O requests, and if you know that some of the WDM I/O request packets (IRPs) that your driver receives do not include WDM file objects, the driver can set the <b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> bit flag. 

If your driver sets the <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext</b>, <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCanUseFsContext2</b>, or <b>WdfFileObjectWdfCannotUseFsContexts</b> value and does <i>not</i> set the <b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> bit flag, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/using-kmdf-verifier">the framework's verifier</a> reports an error for the following cases when the driver calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestgetfileobject">WdfRequestGetFileObject</a> method: 

<ul>
<li>
An IRP does not include a WDM file object.

</li>
<li>
An IRP includes a WDM file object, but the file object is different from the one that the file creation IRP included.

</li>
</ul>
If the <b>WdfFileObjectCanBeOptional</b> bit flag is set, the framework's verifier ignores such cases.
