# WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]</p>

The <b>WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove</b> method informs the framework whether a device can be stopped and removed.


## -parameters




### -param Device [in]

A handle to a framework device object.


### -param Stoppable [in]

A Boolean value that indicates whether the specified device can be stopped and removed. If <b>TRUE</b>, the device can be stopped and removed. If <b>FALSE</b>, the device cannot be stopped and removed.


## -remarks

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.




By default, a device can be stopped and removed. Therefore, a driver typically calls <b>WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove</b> only if it must temporarily set the <i>Stoppable</i> parameter to <b>FALSE</b>. For example, a driver that controls a DVD writer might call <b>WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove</b> with <i>Stoppable</i> set to <b>FALSE</b> before it begins burning a DVD. After the driver has finished burning the DVD, it would call <b>WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove</b> again with <i>Stoppable</i> set to <b>TRUE</b>.  

If your driver's device is supporting a special file (see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicesetspecialfilesupport">WdfDeviceSetSpecialFileSupport</a>), the framework will not allow the device to be stopped or removed. In this case, your driver does not have to call <b>WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove</b> .

The driver must match every call to <b>WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove</b> with <i>Stoppable</i> set to <b>FALSE</b> with a call to <b>WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove</b> with <i>Stoppable</i> set to <b>TRUE</b>.

Calling <b>WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove</b> with <i>Stoppable</i> set to <b>FALSE</b> does not prevent the framework from notifying the driver if the device is unexpectedly removed (surprise-removed).

For more information about how to prevent the operating system from stopping a device, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/handling-requests-to-stop-a-device">Handling Requests to Stop a Device</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example informs the framework that the specified device cannot be stopped and removed.

```cpp
WdfDeviceSetStaticStopRemove(
                             device,
                             FALSE
                             );
```
