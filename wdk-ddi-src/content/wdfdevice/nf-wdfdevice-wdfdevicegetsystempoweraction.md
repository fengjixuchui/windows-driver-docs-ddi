# WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction function


## -description


<p class="CCE_Message">[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]</p>

The <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b> method returns the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/system-power-actions">system power action</a>, if any, that is currently occurring for the computer. 


## -parameters




### -param Device [in]

A handle to a framework device object.


## -returns



<b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b> returns a POWER_ACTION-typed enumerator value. The value indicates the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/system-power-actions">system power action</a> that is currently occurring for the computer. For more information, see the following Remarks section. The POWER_ACTION enumeration is defined in <i>wdm.h</i>.

A bug check occurs if the driver supplies an invalid object handle.




## -remarks



The <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b> method enables a driver to determine whether a device's power transition is occurring because the device is idle (or waking up), or because the entire computer is entering (or leaving) a low-power state. 

The driver must call <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b> only from the event callback functions that the framework calls when the device is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/a-device-enters-a-low-power-state">entering a low-power state</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/a-device-returns-to-its-working-state">returning to its working state</a>. 

The value that <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b> returns depends on the following situations:

<ul>
<li>
If the computer is entering a low-power state when the driver calls <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b>, the method returns the reason that the computer is entering the low-power state. For example, the method returns <b>PowerActionSleep</b> if the computer is entering its S1, S2, or S3 low-power state.

</li>
<li>
If the computer is returning to its working (S0) state from a low-power state when the driver calls <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b>, the method returns the reason that the computer entered the low-power state. For example, the method returns <b>PowerActionSleep</b> if the computer is leaving its S1, S2, or S3 low-power state.

</li>
<li>
If the computer is powering up (after having been turned off) when the driver calls <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b>, the method returns <b>PowerActionNone</b>.

</li>
<li>
If the device is entering a low-power idle state or returning to its working (D0) state when the driver calls <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b>, while the rest of the system remains at its working (S0) state, the method returns <b>PowerActionNone</b>.

</li>
<li>
If the computer and the device are both in their working states when the driver calls <b>WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction</b>, the method returns <b>PowerActionNone</b>.

</li>
</ul>
For more information about low-power states, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/a-device-enters-a-low-power-state">A Device Enters a Low-Power State</a>.


#### Examples

The following code example obtains the power transition activity that is currently occurring for the computer.

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>POWER_ACTION SysPowerAction;

SysPowerAction = WdfDeviceGetSystemPowerAction(device);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
