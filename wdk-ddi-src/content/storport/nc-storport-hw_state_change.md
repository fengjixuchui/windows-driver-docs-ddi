# HW_STATE_CHANGE callback function


## -description

A miniport-provided callback that is called  after a notification from <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected"> StorPortStateChangeDetected</a> is processed.

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension

### -param Context 

[in, optional]
The context supplied as <i>HwStateChangeContext</i> by the miniport in the call to <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected"> StorPortStateChangeDetected</a>.

### -param AddressType 

[in]
The type of the address in <i>Address</i>.

### -param Address 

[in]
A pointer to a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/scsi/ns-scsi-_stor_address">STOR_ADDRESS</a> structure for the entity whose state change was processed.

### -param Status 

[in]
The processing status for the state change notification.


#### - DeviceExtension [in]

A pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area.

## -remarks

The <i>HwStorStateChange</i> is called with the StartIo lock acquired by Storport.

This callback enables miniports to do any additional processing that is needed after hardware addition or removal. If a hardware change occurs on the HBA port or bus, the miniport can call <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected"> StorPortStateChangeDetected</a> to alert the system of the event.

If the value for <i>Status</i> is  < 0x80000000, then the notification processing was successful. Otherwise, the notification process failed.

The name <i>HwStorStateChange</i> is just a placeholder for the miniport function that is pointed to by the <i>HwStateChange</i> parameter of  <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected"> StorPortStateChangeDetected</a>. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:


```
typedef
VOID
HW_STATE_CHANGE (
    _In_ PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
    _In_opt_ PVOID Context,
    _In_ SHORT AddressType,
    _In_ PVOID Address,
    _In_ ULONG Status
    );
```
