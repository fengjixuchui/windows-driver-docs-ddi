# StorPortGetDeviceObjects function


## -description


The <b>StorPortGetDeviceObjects</b> routine returns the device objects that are associated with the adapter device stack. The device objects that will be returned are the functional and physical device objects of the adapter and the device object to which the functional device object is attached. 


## -parameters




### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

A pointer to the hardware device extension for the host bus adapter (HBA).


### -param AdapterDeviceObject [out]

A pointer to receive the functional device object (FDO) of the adapter.


### -param PhysicalDeviceObject [out]

A pointer to receive the physical device object (PDO).


### -param LowerDeviceObject [out]

A pointer to receive the device object of lower device to which the FDO is attached.


## -returns
