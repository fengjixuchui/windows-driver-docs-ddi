# StorPortMarkDeviceFailed function

## -description

The **StorPortMarkDeviceFailed** routine marks a device with failed status.

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension

Pointer to the hardware device extension for the host bus adapter (HBA).

### -param StorAddress

Storage unit device address. This parameter is NULL for adapter devices.

### -param Flags

Set to STORPORT_MARK_DEVICE_FAILED_FLAG_REMOVE_DEVICE to remove the failed device.

### -param FailReason

String that specifies the reason for the device failure along with other details.

## -returns

None.

## -remarks

A miniport driver can call this function to mark a failed device. If STORPORT_MARK_DEVICE_FAILED_FLAG_REMOVE_DEVICE is not set in *Flags*, Storport will only log the event.

The PnP manager will send an IRP to query the failed device's PnP state. If *Flags* is set to STORPORT_MARK_DEVICE_FAILED_FLAG_REMOVE_DEVICE, the PnP manager will then try to remove the failed device.
