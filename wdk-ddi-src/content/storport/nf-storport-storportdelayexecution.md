description: The StorPortDelayExecution function delays the current thread by the given amount of time, in microseconds. If the current IRQL is lower than DISPATCH_LEVEL then the current thread is simply put in the wait state and other threads are allowed to run. Otherwise, this routine performs a busy-wait.
