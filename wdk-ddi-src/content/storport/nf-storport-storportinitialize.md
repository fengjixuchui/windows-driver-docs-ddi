# StorPortInitialize function


## -description

The **StorPortInitialize** routine initializes the port driver parameters and extension data. **StorPortInitialize** also saves the adapter information provided from the [miniport driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storage-miniport-drivers) **DriverEntry** routine.

## -parameters

### -param Argument1 

[in]
The first pointer with which the operating system called the miniport's DriverEntry routine.

### -param Argument2 

[in]
The second pointer with which the operating system called the miniports's DriverEntry routine.

### -param HwInitializationData 

[in]
Pointer to the initialization and configuration information set by the miniport driver in its DriverEntry routine.

### -param HwContext 

[in, optional]
Is the address of a context value to be passed to the miniport driver's [**HwStorFindAdapter**](nc-storport-hw_find_adapter.md) routine. Only legacy miniport drivers that scan the bus for HBAs rather than receiving configuration information from the port driver can use this parameter to store state between calls to **HwStorFindAdapter**.

## -returns

The result of the initialization actions performed by **StorPortInitialize**. The miniport driver will return this value as the return value for its DriverEntry routine.

**StorPortInitialize** returns one of the following status codes:

| Return code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER** | *Argument1* is NULL, or *Argument2* is NULL, OR *HwInitializationData* is NULL. |
| **STATUS_SUCCESS**           | The driver extension data and adapter information were initialized successfully. |
| **STATUS_NO_MEMORY**         | No memory is available to store an initialization parameter. |
| **STATUS_REVISION_MISMATCH** | The version of the structure pointed to by *HwInitializationData* is invalid for the current operating system. |
| **STATUS_INSUFFICENT_RESOURCES** | The allocation failed for the driver object extension data. |

## -remarks

This routine must be called from the miniport driver's **DriverEntry** routine.

Because Storport miniport drivers must support PnP, the Storport driver does not use the *HwContext* parameter passed to **StorPortInitialize**.

Every miniport driver's DriverEntry routine must call **StorPortInitialize** after the miniport driver has first zeroed and then set the members of [**HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA**](ns-storport-_hw_initialization_data-r1.md).
