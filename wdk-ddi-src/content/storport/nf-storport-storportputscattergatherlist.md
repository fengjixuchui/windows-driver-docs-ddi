# StorPortPutScatterGatherList function


## -description

The <b>StorPortPutScatterGatherList</b> routine releases any resources associated with a scatter/gather list that was previously created by a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportbuildscattergatherlist">StorPortBuildScatterGatherList</a> routine.

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension 

[in]
A pointer to the hardware device extension for the host bus adapter (HBA).

### -param ScatterGatherList 

[in]
A pointer to a buffer that contains a scatter/gather list that was previously created by a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportbuildscattergatherlist">StorPortBuildScatterGatherList</a> routine.

### -param WriteToDevice 

[in]
A value that indicates the direction of the DMA transfer that has completed. A value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates a transfer from the data buffer to the device, and <b>FALSE</b> indicates a transfer from the device to the data buffer.

## -returns

<b>StorPortPutScatterGatherList</b> returns one of the following status codes:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</b></dt>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>

</td>
<td width="60%">

</td>

<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The <i>HwDeviceExtension</i> that was passed was <b>NULL</b>.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STOR_STATUS_INVALID_IRQL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The call was made at an invalid IRQL.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

The <b>StorPortPutScatterGatherList</b> routine does not free the buffer memory for the scatter/gather list, because the miniport driver allocated this memory. 

After the <b>StorPortPutScatterGatherList</b> routine returns, the miniport driver can reuse the buffer to create a new scatter/gather list by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportbuildscattergatherlist">StorPortBuildScatterGatherList</a> again. If a miniport driver has finished using the buffer for the scatter/gather list, it should free the memory for the buffer after the <b>StorPortPutScatterGatherList</b> routine returns. If the miniport driver allocates the buffer memory with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportallocatepool">StorPortAllocatePool</a> routine, it should free the memory by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportfreepool">StorPortFreePool</a> routine.
