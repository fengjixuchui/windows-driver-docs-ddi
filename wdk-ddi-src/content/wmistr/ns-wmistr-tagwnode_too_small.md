# tagWNODE_TOO_SMALL structure


## -description


The <b>WNODE_TOO_SMALL</b> structure indicates the size of the buffer needed to receive output from a request.


## -struct-fields




### -field WnodeHeader

Is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmistr/ns-wmistr-_wnode_header">WNODE_HEADER</a> structure that contains information common to all <b>WNODE_<i>XXX</i></b> structures, such as the buffer size, the GUID that represents a data block associated with a request, and flags that provide information about the <b>WNODE_<i>XXX</i></b> data being passed or returned.


### -field SizeNeeded

Specifies the size of the buffer needed to receive all of the <b>WNODE_<i>XXX</i></b> data to be returned.


## -remarks



When the buffer for a WMI request is too small to receive all of the data to be returned, a driver fills in a <b>WNODE_TOO_SMALL</b> structure to indicate the required buffer size. WMI can then increase the buffer to the recommended size and issue the request again. A driver is responsible for managing any side effects caused by handling the same request more than once.
