# _STI_DEVICE_STATUS structure


## -description


The STI_DEVICE_STATUS structure is used as a parameter to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sti/nf-sti-istidevice-getstatus">IStiDevice::GetStatus</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/stiusd/nf-stiusd-istiusd-getstatus">IStiUSD::GetStatus</a> methods.


## -struct-fields




### -field dwSize

Caller-supplied size, in bytes, of the STI_DEVICE_STATUS structure.


### -field StatusMask

One or more caller-supplied bit flags, indicating the type of status information being requested. The following flags are defined:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STI_DEVSTATUS_EVENTS_STATE

</td>
<td>
The driver should fill in the <b>dwEventHandlingState</b> member.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STI_DEVSTATUS_ONLINE_STATE 

</td>
<td>
The driver should fill in the <b>dwOnlineState</b> member.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 


### -field dwOnlineState

Bit flags indicating the device's current status. The following flags are defined in <i>Sti.h</i>.

Currently use of STI_ONLINESTATE_OPERATIONAL is required, while use of all other flags is optional. (Currently, STI_ONLINESTATE_OPERATIONAL is the only flag that the still image server checks.)





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_BUSY

The device is busy.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_ERROR

The device has reported an error.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_INITIALIZING

The device is being initialized.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_IO_ACTIVE

The device is active but not accepting commands.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_OFFLINE

The device is off-line.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_OPERATIONAL

The device is online and ready. If set, Control Panel indicates the device is ready. Otherwise, it indicates the device is off-line.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_PAPER_JAM

The device has reported a paper jam.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_PAPER_PROBLEM

The device has reported an unspecified paper problem.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_PAUSED

The device is paused.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_PENDING

I/O operations are pending.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_POWER_SAVE

The device is in power save mode.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_TRANSFERRING

The device is transferring data.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_USER_INTERVENTION

The device requires user intervention.





#### STI_ONLINESTATE_WARMING_UP

The device is warming up.


### -field dwHardwareStatusCode

Optional device-specific, vendor-defined value.


### -field dwEventHandlingState

Contains bit flags indicating event status. The following flags are defined in <i>Sti.h</i>.





#### STI_EVENTHANDLING_ENABLED

<i>Not used</i>.





#### STI_EVENTHANDLING_PENDING

A device event has occurred.





#### STI_EVENTHANDLING_POLLING

<i>Not used</i>.


### -field dwPollingInterval

Time value, in milliseconds, indicating how often the device should be polled, if polling is required.
