# IStiDevice::Initialize


## -description


The <b>IStiDevice::Initialize</b> method initializes an instance of the COM object that defines the <b>IStiDevice</b> interface. <i>This method is for internal use only</i>.


## -parameters




### -param hinst [in]

Caller-supplied instance handle of the calling process. This handle is obtained by calling <b>GetModuleName</b>(NULL).


### -param pwszDeviceName [in]

Caller-supplied pointer to a string representing an internal device name, obtained by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff543790(v=vs.85)">IStillImage::GetSTILaunchInformation</a>.


### -param dwVersion

Caller-supplied STI version number. This value must be STI_VERSION, defined in <i>Sti.h</i>.


### -param dwMode

Caller-supplied constant value indicating the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/image/transfer-modes">Transfer Modes</a> in which the device is to be used. The following values are valid.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Mode</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STI_DEVICE_CREATE_BOTH

</td>
<td>
The device is being opened for both obtaining status and transferring data.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STI_DEVICE_CREATE_DATA

</td>
<td>
The device is being opened only for data transfers.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STI_DEVICE_CREATE_STATUS

</td>
<td>
The device is being opened only for obtaining status information.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 


## -returns



If the operation succeeds, the method returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.




## -remarks



The <b>IStiDevice::Initialize</b> method initializes the COM object instance that was created by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff543778(v=vs.85)">IStillImage::CreateDevice</a>.

Because <b>IStiDevice::Initialize</b> is called by <b>IStillImage::CreateDevice</b>, clients of the <b>IStiDevice</b> interface do not typically call this method directly.
