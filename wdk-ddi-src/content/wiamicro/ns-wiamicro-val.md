# VAL structure

## -description

The VAL structure is used by the microdriver and WIA Flatbed driver to pass information between each other.

## -struct-fields

### -field lVal

Specifies a command value to return to the WIA Flatbed driver. See [WIA Microdriver Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/image/wia-microdriver-commands) for a list of available commands for this parameter.

### -field dblVal

Specifies a command value to return to the WIA Flatbed driver. See [WIA Microdriver Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/image/wia-microdriver-commands) for a list of available commands for this parameter.

### -field pGuid

Points to the GUID of the pressed button. If no button was pressed, this member points to GUID_NULL.

### -field pScanInfo

Points to a [SCANINFO](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wiamicro/ns-wiamicro-_scaninfo) structure.

### -field handle

Points to a ShutDown event handle that will be signaled by the WIA Flatbed Driver when the driver is being unloaded or shut down. 

### -field ppButtonNames

Specifies the address of a pointer to an array of button names.

### -field pHandle

Points to an event handle.

### -field lReserved

Reserved. Do not use.

### -field szVal

Specifies the device name in ASCII form. If needed for interrupt checking, the microdriver can use this name to pass to [CreateFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) in order to obtain a file handle to the device.
