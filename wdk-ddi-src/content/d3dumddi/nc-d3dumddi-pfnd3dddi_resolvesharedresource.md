# PFND3DDDI_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE callback function


## -description

The <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> function informs a user-mode display driver that ownership of a shared surface changed or that a surface is being used for GDI interoperation.

## -parameters

### -param hDevice

A handle to the display device (that is, the graphics context) that is associated with the shared surface or GDI interoperable surface.

### -param Arg2

*pData* [in]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_resolvesharedresource">D3DDDIARG_RESOLVESHAREDRESOURCE</a> structure that contains a handle to the surface.

## -returns

<i>ResolveSharedResource</i> returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|S_OK|The resource is successfully resolved.|
|D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED|The driver detects that the graphics adapter was removed. Therefore, the driver did not complete the operation. If the driver never notices the adapter-removal condition, the driver is not required to return this error code.|

## -remarks

The Direct3D runtime calls <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> when an application calls one of the following functions:

<ul>
<li>
<b>IDXGIKeyedMutex::ReleaseSynch</b> on a synchronized shared surface 

</li>
<li>
<b>IDXGISurface1::GetDC</b> for a GDI interoperable surface 

</li>
</ul>
The runtime calls the driver's <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> function every time a shared surface owner changes or when a surface is used for GDI interoperation. The runtime supplies <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> with handles to the display device--via the <i>hDevice</i> parameter-- and the surface--via the <i>pData</i> parameter.

The driver implements <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> to appropriately manage resources for multiple GPU scenarios. Each resource might be divided across memory for multiple GPUs to render on. The driver can implement <i>ResolveSharedResource</i> to remerge each resource so that the new resource owner has the merged resource. The driver must flush any partially built command buffers that might modify the resource.
