# _D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO structure


## -description


The D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO structure describes the portions of a buffer that are encrypted. 


## -struct-fields




### -field NumEncryptedBytesAtBeginning

[in] The number of bytes at the beginning of the buffer that are encrypted. 


### -field NumBytesInSkipPattern

[in] The number of bytes in the buffer that are skipped from encryption before encryption starts again. 


### -field NumBytesInEncryptPattern

[in] The number of bytes in the buffer that are encrypted after the skip pattern, which the <b>NumBytesInSkipPattern</b> member specifies. The skip and encrypt pattern is then repeated until the buffer ends. For more information about the skip-encrypt pattern, see the Remarks section. 


## -remarks



Because the buffer's encrypted portion is specified in bytes, an application must ensure that the encrypted blocks match the GPU's crypto-block alignment. 

The runtime can specify a populated D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO structure in the block of memory that the <b>pEncryptedBlockInfo</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_decryptionblt">D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT</a> structure points to when the runtime calls the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_decryptionblt">DecryptionBlt</a> function to write data to a protected surface. 

The following examples show how the runtime can partition a buffer's encryption.

<ol>
<li>The following values encrypt the first 100 bytes of the buffer and skip the remaining buffer data:<ul>
<li><b>NumEncryptedBytesAtBeginning</b> = 100;</li>
<li><b>NumBytesInSkipPattern</b> = 0;</li>
<li><b>NumBytesInEnycryptPattern</b> = 0;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following values encrypt the first 100 bytes of the buffer, skips the next 20 bytes, and then encrypt the next 2 bytes blocks. The process is then repeated where these values skip 20 bytes and encrypt 2 bytes until the end of the buffer.<ul>
<li><b>NumEncryptedBytesAtBeginning</b> = 100;</li>
<li><b>NumBytesInSkipPattern</b> = 20;</li>
<li><b>NumBytesInEnycryptPattern</b> = 2;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
