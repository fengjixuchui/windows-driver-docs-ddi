# _D3DDDICB_PRESENT structure


## -description

The D3DDDICB_PRESENT structure describes allocations that content is copied to and from.

## -struct-fields

### -field hSrcAllocation

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the source allocation. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime's <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_allocatecb">pfnAllocateCb</a> function returns this handle. Therefore, the user-mode display driver should use this handle to copy content from.

### -field hDstAllocation

[in] A D3DKMT_HANDLE data type that represents a kernel-mode handle to the destination allocation. <b>hDstAllocation</b> can be zero if the destination is unknown; kernel mode will determine the destination just before DMA of the hardware command stream to the graphics processor.

### -field hContext

[in] A handle to the context that the driver submits the copy operation to. The user-mode display driver previously created this context by calling the <a href="/previous-versions/ff568895(v=vs.85)">pfnCreateContextCb</a> function.

### -field BroadcastContextCount

[in] The number of additional contexts in the array that the <b>BroadcastContext</b> member specifies.

### -field BroadcastContext

[in] An array of handles to the additional contexts to broadcast the current present operation to. The D3DDDI_MAX_BROADCAST_CONTEXT constant, which is defined as 64, defines the maximum number of additional contexts that the user-mode display driver can broadcast the current present operation to. 

Broadcasting is supported only for flip operations. To broadcast a flip operation, the display miniport driver must support memory mapped I/O (MMIO)-based flips. To indicate support of MMIO flips, the display miniport driver sets the <b>FlipOnVSyncMmIo</b> bit-field flag in the <b>FlipCaps</b> member of the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_drivercaps">DXGK_DRIVERCAPS</a> structure when its <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function is called.

The original context that the <b>hContext</b> member specifies and that the user-mode display driver presents to is not an element in the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array. For example, if the <b>BroadcastContext</b> array contains one element, the user-mode display driver sends the present operation to the owning context (<b>hContext</b>) and broadcasts to that one additional context.

### -field BroadcastSrcAllocation

 
Allocations which content will be presented.

### -field BroadcastDstAllocation

 
If non-zero, represents the destination allocations of the present.

### -field PrivateDriverDataSize

Private driver data size in bytes.

### -field pPrivateDriverData

Private driver data to pass to DdiPresent.

### -field bOptimizeForComposition

DWM is involved in composition.

### -field SyncIntervalOverrideValid

Override app sync interval is valid.

### -field SyncIntervalOverride

 
Override app sync interval.
