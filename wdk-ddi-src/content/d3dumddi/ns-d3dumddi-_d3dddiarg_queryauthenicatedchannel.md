# _D3DDDIARG_QUERYAUTHENICATEDCHANNEL structure


## -description


The D3DDDIARG_QUERYAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL structure describes authenticated-channel information to query by using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryauthenticatedchannel">QueryAuthenticatedChannel</a> function. 


## -struct-fields




### -field InputSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the input data that the <b>pInputData</b> member points to. 


### -field pInputData

[in] A pointer to a buffer that describes the information to query. The buffer that <b>pInputData</b> points to is defined identically to the input buffer that is passed to the <b>IDirect3DAuthenticatedChannel::Query</b> method. For more information about <b>IDirect3DAuthenticatedChannel::Query</b>, see the Windows SDK documentation. 


### -field OutputSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the output data that the <b>pOutputData</b> member points to. 


### -field pOutputData

[in/out] A pointer to a buffer that describes the information that the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryauthenticatedchannel">QueryAuthenticatedChannel</a> function returns. The buffer that <b>pOutputData</b> points to is defined identically to the output buffer that the <b>IDirect3DAuthenticatedChannel::Query</b> method returns. 


## -remarks



The definitions of the input and output buffers to which the <b>pInputData</b> and <b>pOutputData</b> members point, depend on the type of information. The first member of the input buffer is always a D3DAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL_QUERY_INPUT structure, whose <b>QueryType</b> member identifies the type of information to query.

The definition of the output buffer also depends on the information that the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_queryauthenticatedchannel">QueryAuthenticatedChannel</a> function queries. However, the first member of the output buffer is always a D3DAUTHENTICATEDCHANNEL_QUERY_OUTPUT structure, whose members specify the following information:

<ul>
<li>
The <b>omac</b> member identifies the One-key Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)-mode message authentication code (OMAC) that permits the caller to authenticate the entire buffer, which prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

</li>
<li>
The <b>QueryType</b>, <b>hChannel</b>, and <b>SequenceNumber</b> members from the input buffer prevent against replay attacks. 

</li>
</ul>
