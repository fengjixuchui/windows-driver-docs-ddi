# _D3DDDI_UNLOCKASYNCFLAGS structure


## -description


The D3DDDI_UNLOCKASYNCFLAGS structure identifies how to unlock a resource.


## -struct-fields




### -field NotifyOnly

A UINT value that specifies whether the unlock call is for notification only. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime sets <b>NotifyOnly</b> to <b>TRUE</b> when it unlocks runtime-allocated system memory surfaces. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_UNLOCKASYNCFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies how to unlock a resource.
