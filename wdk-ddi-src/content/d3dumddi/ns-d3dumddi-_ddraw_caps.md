# _DDRAW_CAPS structure


## -description


The DDRAW_CAPS structure describes general Microsoft DirectDraw capabilities that the user-mode display driver supports.


## -struct-fields




### -field Caps

[out] A valid bitwise OR of the following general capability bits that the driver supports.

| **Capability bit** | **Meaning** | 
|:--|:--|
| DDRAW_CAPS_ZBLTS | Z-buffers can be used in bit-block transfer (bitblt) operations. | 
| DDRAW_CAPS_COLORKEY | Some form of color key can be used in either overlay or bitblt operations. For more specific color key capability information, see the CKeyCaps member. | 
| DDRAW_CAPS_BLTDEPTHFILL | Z-buffers can be depth-filled in bitblt operations. | 


### -field Caps2

[out] A valid bitwise OR of more of the following general capability bits that the driver supports.

| **Capability bit** | **Meaning** | 
|:--|:--|
| DDRAW_CAPS2_VIDEOPORT | A hardware video port can be used. | 
| DDRAW_CAPS2_CANDROPZ16BIT | Sixteen-bit RGBZ values can be converted into 16-bit RGB values. (The system does not support 8-bit conversions.) | 
| DDRAW_CAPS2_FLIPINTERVAL | The driver responds to the Flip bit-field flag. | 
| DDRAW_CAPS2_FLIPNOVSYNC | The driver responds to the FlipWithNoWait bit-field flag. | 
| DDRAW_CAPS2_DYNAMICTEXTURES | The driver supports dynamic textures. | 



### -field CKeyCaps

[out] A valid bitwise OR of the following color key capability bits that the driver supports.

| **Capability bit** | **Meaning** | 
|:--|:--|
| DDRAW_CKEYCAPS_SRCBLT | Transparent bit-block transfers can be performed with a color key that identifies bits of the source surface that are copied to the destination surface. | 
| DDRAW_CKEYCAPS_DESTBLT | Transparent bit-block transfers (bitblts) can be performed with a color key that identifies the replaceable bits of the destination surface. | 



### -field FxCaps

[out] A valid bitwise OR of the following stretching and effects capability bits that the driver supports.

| **Capability bit** | **Meaning** | 
|:--|:--|
| DDRAW_FXCAPS_BLTMIRRORLEFTRIGHT | Bit-block transfers (bitblts) that flip the contents of the source surface to the destination surface horizontally along the center axis can be performed. | 
| DDRAW_FXCAPS_BLTMIRRORUPDOWN | Bit-block transfers (bitblts) that flip the contents of the source surface to the destination surface vertically along the center axis can be performed. | 


### -field MaxVideoPorts

[out] The maximum number of video ports that the device supports.
