# D3DDDICB_EVICT structure


## -description

<b>D3DKMT_EVICT</b> is used with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_evictcb">pfnEvictCb</a> to subtract one from the residency reference count.

Once this count reaches zero, it will remove the allocation from the device residency list.

## -struct-fields

### -field NumAllocations

[in] Number of allocation handles in the <b>AllocationList</b> array.

### -field AllocationList

[in] An array of <b>NumAllocations</b> allocation handles to mark for eviction. All allocations must be created on <b>hDevice</b>.

### -field Flags

[in] Specifies eviction behavior as documented in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dukmdt/ns-d3dukmdt-d3dddi_evict_flags">D3DDDI_EVICT_FLAGS</a>.

### -field NumBytesToTrim

[out] When non-zero, specifies how much the application should evict in order to meet its current memory budget.
