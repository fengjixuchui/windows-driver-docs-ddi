# PFND3DDDI_CRYPTOSESSIONKEYEXCHANGE callback function

## -description

The <b>CryptoSessionKeyExchange</b> function negotiates a session key.

## -parameters

### -param hDevice

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### -param Arg2

*pData* [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_cryptosessionkeyexchange">D3DDDIARG_CRYPTOSESSIONKEYEXCHANGE</a> structure that describes a session key that is used for encryption.

## -returns

<b>CryptoSessionKeyExchange</b> returns one of the following values:

| **Return code** | **Description** | 
|:--|:--|
| **S_OK** | The session key is successfully exchanged. | 
| **E_OUTOFMEMORY** | [CryptoSessionKeyExchange](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_cryptosessionkeyexchange)  could not allocate the required memory for it to complete. |

## -remarks

The driver should only support a single key exchange mechanism for each encryption type. Microsoft has standardized the key exchange type D3DKEYEXCHANGE_RSAES_OAEP. However, hardware vendors can use proprietary key exchange mechanisms. 

For D3DKEYEXCHANGE_RSAES_OAEP, the <b>pData</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_cryptosessionkeyexchange">D3DDDIARG_CRYPTOSESSIONKEYEXCHANGE</a> structure points to a buffer that contains the session key that an application previously RSAES-OAEP-encrypted with the public key from the driver's crypto session certificate. The actual size of the buffer is 256 bytes. This exchange is identical to how the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/supporting-output-protection-manager">Output Protection Manager</a> (OPM) key exchange works, except the OPM buffer contains additional data besides the session key. The same certificate that is used for OPM key exchange can be used for the D3DKEYEXCHANGE_RSAES_OAEP key exchange.
