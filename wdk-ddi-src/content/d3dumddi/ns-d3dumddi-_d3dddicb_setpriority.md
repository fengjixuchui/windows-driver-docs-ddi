# _D3DDDICB_SETPRIORITY structure


## -description


The D3DDDICB_SETPRIORITY structure describes the priority level to which to set a resource or list of allocations. 


## -struct-fields




### -field hResource

[in] A handle to a resource whose priority must be set. If the user-mode display driver uses the array that is specified by <b>HandleList</b> to set the priority for the list of allocations, it sets <b>hResource</b> to <b>NULL</b>. If the user-mode display driver sets <b>hResource</b> to a non-<b>NULL</b> value, it must set the <b>NumAllocations</b> member to zero and <b>HandleList</b> to <b>NULL</b>. 

If <b>hResource</b> is non-<b>NULL</b>, all of the allocations that belong to the resource are set to the priority that is specified by the first element in the array that <b>pPriorities</b> points to. 


### -field NumAllocations

[in] The number of allocations in the <b>HandleList</b> array. If the user-mode display driver sets the handle in the <b>hResource</b> member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value, it must set <b>NumAllocations</b> to zero.


### -field HandleList

[in] An array of D3DKMT_HANDLE data types that represent kernel-mode handles to the allocations. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_allocatecb">pfnAllocateCb</a> function returns these handles. Therefore, the user-mode display driver uses these handles to set priority for the allocations.

If the user-mode display driver sets the handle in the <b>hResource</b> member to a non-<b>NULL</b> value, it must set <b>HandleList</b> to <b>NULL</b>. 


### -field pPriorities

[in] A pointer to an array of priority levels. If the <b>hResource</b> member is non-<b>NULL</b>, the array must contain a single element. If <b>hResource</b> is <b>NULL</b>, the number of elements in the array is specified by the <b>NumAllocations</b> member, and each allocation in the array that is specified by <b>HandleList</b> is set to the priority level of the corresponding element in <b>pPriorities</b>. For a list of defined priority levels, see the Remarks section of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_setprioritycb">pfnSetPriorityCb</a> reference page.
