# _D3DDDI_OVERLAYCOLORCONTROLSFLAGS structure


## -description


The D3DDDI_OVERLAYCOLORCONTROLSFLAGS structure identifies color-control settings that the overlay hardware supports.


## -struct-fields




### -field Brightness

A UINT value that specifies whether brightness adjustments to the overlay are enabled. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field Contrast

A UINT value that specifies whether contrast adjustments to the overlay are enabled. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field Hue

A UINT value that specifies whether hue adjustments to the overlay are enabled. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).


### -field Saturation

A UINT value that specifies whether saturation adjustments to the overlay are enabled.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).


### -field Sharpness

A UINT value that specifies whether sharpness adjustments to the overlay are enabled.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fifth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000010).


### -field Gamma

A UINT value that specifies whether gamma adjustments to the overlay are enabled.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the sixth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000020).


### -field ColorEnable

A UINT value that specifies whether color-enable adjustments to the overlay are enabled.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the seventh bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000040).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 25 bits (0xFFFFFF80) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_OVERLAYCOLORCONTROLSFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies color-control settings that the overlay hardware supports.
