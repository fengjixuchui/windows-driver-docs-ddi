# _D3DDDI_PRESENTFLAGS structure


## -description


The D3DDDI_PRESENTFLAGS structure identifies how to perform a present operation.


## -struct-fields




### -field Blt

A UINT value that specifies whether to perform a bit-block transfer (bitblt) data to the primary surface. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field ColorFill

A UINT value that specifies whether to perform a colorfill bitblt to the primary surface . 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field Flip

A UINT value that specifies whether to flip to a new surface. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).


### -field AllowTearing

 


### -field AllowFlexibleRefresh

 


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 29 bits (0xFFFFFFF8) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_PRESENTFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies how to perform a present operation.
