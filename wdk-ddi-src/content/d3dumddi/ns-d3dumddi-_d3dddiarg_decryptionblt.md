# _D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT structure


## -description


The D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT structure describes the parameters of an decrypted bit-block transfer (bitblt) in a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_decryptionblt">DecryptionBlt</a> function. 


## -struct-fields




### -field hCryptoSession

[in] A handle to the encryption session. 


### -field hSrcResource

[in] A handle to the source resource.


### -field SrcSubResourceIndex

[in] The index to the source surface within the resource. 


### -field hDstResource

[in] A handle to the destination resource. 


### -field DstSubResourceIndex

[in] The index to the destination surface within the resource. 


### -field SrcResourceSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the source resource. 


### -field pEncryptedBlockInfo

[in] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiencrypted_block_info">D3DDDIENCRYPTED_BLOCK_INFO</a> structure that describes the portions of the buffer that are encrypted. 


### -field pContentKey

[in] A pointer to a block of memory that contains the content key that is required to decrypt the bitblt data. If <b>pContentKey</b> is <b>NULL</b>, hardware does not require a separate content key to decrypt the data. That is, the session key is used to encrypt the data. 


### -field pIV

[in] A pointer to a block of memory that contains the initialization vector that is required to decrypt the bitblt data. If <b>pIV</b> is <b>NULL</b>, hardware does not require a separate initialization vector to decrypt the data. That is, the session key is used to encrypt the data. 


## -remarks



A pointer to a populated D3DDDIARG_DECRYPTIONBLT structure is passed to the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_decryptionblt">DecryptionBlt</a> function to write data to a protected surface.
