# _D3DDDICB_DEALLOCATE structure


## -description


The D3DDDICB_DEALLOCATE structure describes allocations to release. 


## -struct-fields




### -field hResource

[in] A handle to a resource whose associated allocations must be released. If the user-mode display driver uses the array that is specified by <b>HandleList</b> to specify the allocations to release, it sets <b>hResource</b> to <b>NULL</b>.


### -field NumAllocations

[in] The number of allocations in the <b>HandleList</b> array. If the user-mode display driver sets the handle in the <b>hResource</b> member to non-<b>NULL</b>, <b>NumAllocations</b> is ignored by the Microsoft Direct3D runtime.


### -field HandleList

[in] An array of D3DKMT_HANDLE data types that represent kernel-mode handles to the allocations. The Direct3D runtime's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_allocatecb">pfnAllocateCb</a> function returns these handles. Therefore, the user-mode display driver uses these handles to release the allocations.

If the user-mode display driver sets the handle in the <b>hResource</b> member to non-<b>NULL</b>, <b>HandleList</b> is ignored by the Direct3D runtime.
