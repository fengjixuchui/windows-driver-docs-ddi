# _D3DDDIARG_GETPITCH structure


## -description


The D3DDDIARG_GETPITCH structure describes an encrypted surface for which the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getpitch">GetPitch</a> function retrieves the pitch. 


## -struct-fields




### -field hCryptoSession

[in] A handle to the encryption session. 


### -field hResource

[in] A handle to the resource. 


### -field SubResourceIndex

[in] The zero-based index into the resource, which the <b>hResource</b> handle specifies. This index indicates the encrypted surface.


### -field Pitch

[out] The pitch, in bytes, of the encrypted surface. The user-mode display driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_getpitch">GetPitch</a> function returns this pitch value to the Direct3D runtime.
