# _D3DDDICB_RENDERFLAGS structure


## -description

The D3DDDICB_RENDERFLAGS structure identifies information about a command buffer to be rendered.

## -struct-fields

### -field ResizeCommandBuffer

A UINT value that specifies whether to resize the command buffer. The driver puts the requested size in the <b>NewCommandBufferSize</b> member of the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_render">D3DDDICB_RENDER</a> structure. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).

### -field ResizeAllocationList

A UINT value that specifies whether to resize the allocation list. The driver puts the requested number of elements in the <b>NewAllocationListSize</b> member of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_render">D3DDDICB_RENDER</a>. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).

### -field ResizePatchLocationList

A UINT value that specifies whether to resize the patch-location list. The driver puts the requested number of elements in the <b>NewPatchLocationListSize</b> member of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_render">D3DDDICB_RENDER</a>. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).

### -field NullRendering

A UINT value that specifies whether the graphics processing unit (GPU) should process any commands for the rendering context. The <b>NullRendering</b> bit-field flag is set to inform the GPU not to process any commands for the rendering context. The <b>NullRendering</b> bit-field flag is set only during performance investigating and debugging to simulate an infinitely fast rendering engine that still must perform the overhead of DMA buffer submission and signaling. <b>NullRendering</b> is never set during typical operations. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 28 bits (0xFFFFFFF0) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.

### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDICB_RENDERFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies information about a command buffer to be rendered.
