# _D3DDDICB_OFFERALLOCATIONS structure


## -description

Defines the video memory allocations that the driver offers for reuse. Used with the  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_offerallocationscb">pfnOfferAllocationsCb</a> function.

## -struct-fields

### -field pResources

[in] An array of Direct3D runtime handles to resources to offer.

If the user-mode driver uses the array specified by <b>HandleList</b> to offer a list of allocations, it must set <b>pResources</b> to <b>NULL</b>. Conversely, if the driver uses the array specified by <b>pResources</b> to offer a list of resources, it must set <b>HandleList</b> to <b>NULL</b>.

### -field HandleList

[in] An array of D3DKMT_HANDLE data types that represent kernel-mode handles to allocations to offer.

If resources were created with the <b>D3D10_DDI_BIND_PRESENT</b> flag value set in <i>pCreateResource</i>-><b>BindFlags</b>, offer the resources by their allocation handles, not by their resource handles.

### -field NumAllocations

[in] The number of items in the <b>pResources</b> or <b>HandleList</b> members, whichever is not <b>NULL</b>.

### -field Priority

[in] The priority, of type  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dukmdt/ne-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_offer_priority">D3DDDI_OFFER_PRIORITY</a>, with which to offer the allocations for reuse.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  Do not set this member to a value of <b>D3DDDI_OFFER_PRIORITY_NONE</b>.</div>
<div> </div>
