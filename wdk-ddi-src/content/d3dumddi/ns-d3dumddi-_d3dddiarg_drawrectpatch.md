# _D3DDDIARG_DRAWRECTPATCH structure


## -description


The D3DDDIARG_DRAWRECTPATCH structure describes a rectangular patch to draw. 


## -struct-fields




### -field Handle

[in] The handle to the patch surface.


## -remarks



The <b>Handle</b> member refers to the patch surface, so that the next time the patch surface is drawn, the Microsoft Direct3D runtime is not required to re-specify the D3DRECTPATCH_INFO data structure for the patch surface. The user-mode display driver can precompute and cache forward-difference coefficients and any other information, which allows subsequent calls to the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawrectpatch">DrawRectPatch</a> function that use the same handle to run more efficiently.
