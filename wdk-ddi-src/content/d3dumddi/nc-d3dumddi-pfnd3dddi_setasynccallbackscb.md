# PFND3DDDI_SETASYNCCALLBACKSCB callback function


## -description


The <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b> function notifies the Microsoft Direct3D runtime whether the runtime will start or stop receiving calls to the runtime's callback functions from a worker thread.


## -parameters




### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param Enable [in]

A Boolean value that specifies whether the runtime will start or stop receiving calls to the runtime's callback functions from a worker thread. <b>TRUE</b> indicates that the runtime will start receiving calls to its callback functions from a worker thread; <b>FALSE</b> indicates that the runtime will stop receiving calls to its callback functions from a worker thread.


## -returns



<b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b> returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|S_OK|The Direct3D runtime was successfully notified.|
|E_INVALIDARG|Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect.|

This function might also return other HRESULT values.






## -remarks



If a user-mode display driver implements its own multiple-processor optimizations (that is, the driver creates a worker thread and processes commands in that thread), the driver must call <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b> to notify the Direct3D runtime whether the runtime will start or stop receiving calls to the runtime's callback functions from the worker thread. Additionally, such drivers must not implement the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_lockasync">LockAsync</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_unlockasync">UnlockAsync</a>, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rename">Rename</a> functions. This ensures that the runtime does not attempt to use its own multiple-processor optimizations. 

The user-mode display driver can call <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b> only on the main application thread (that is, the thread that called into the driver). The driver's worker thread cannot call <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b>. At any point in time, only one thread that references a particular rendering device can run in any of the runtime's callback functions. 

Before the user-mode display driver calls any of the runtime's callback functions on a thread other than the main application thread, the driver must pass <b>TRUE</b> to the <i>Enable</i> parameter in a call to <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b>. Before the user-mode display driver calls any of the runtime's callback functions on the main application thread, the driver must pass <b>FALSE</b> to the <i>Enable</i> parameter in a call to <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b>. 

Within the implementation of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfworkitem-flush">Flush</a> for each rendering device, the driver calls <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b> and passes <b>FALSE</b> to the <i>Enable</i> parameter.

When the driver passes <b>TRUE</b> to the <i>Enable</i> parameter in a call to <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b>, the runtime puts itself in a state where it does not immediately respond to device-lost situations in its callback functions. Instead, when the runtime detects a device lost in a callback function while in this state, it sets a bit that indicates that the event occurred. When the driver passes <b>FALSE</b> to the <i>Enable</i> parameter in a call to <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b>, the runtime checks the bit to determine if a device lost occurred. If the bit is set, the runtime performs its typical device-lost handling. After this point, the driver no longer receives most calls to its functions from the runtime. 

Only DirectX 9 and DirectX 9L versions of the runtime support <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b>. DirectX 10 and later versions of the runtime set the <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_devicecallbacks">D3DDDI_DEVICECALLBACKS</a> structure to <b>NULL</b> when the runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_createdevice">CreateDevice(D3D10)</a> function to create a rendering device. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    DirectX versions earlier than 9 do not support multiple-processor optimizations. </div>
<div> </div>
Drivers can call the runtime's callback functions only from a worker thread if the runtime previously set the <b>pfnSetAsyncCallbacksCb</b> member of D3DDDI_DEVICECALLBACKS to non-<b>NULL</b> in a call to the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_createdevice">CreateDevice</a> function.
