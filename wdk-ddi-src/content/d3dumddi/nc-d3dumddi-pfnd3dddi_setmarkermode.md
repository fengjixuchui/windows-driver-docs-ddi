# PFND3DDDI_SETMARKERMODE callback function

## -description

Notifies the user-mode display driver that it should support a type of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) marker event. Optionally implemented by Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.3 and later drivers running on Microsoft Direct3D Level 9 hardware. (See requirements in [Direct3D rendering performance improvements](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/direct3d-rendering-performance-improvements).) For more advanced hardware, drivers should implement the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3dwddm1_3ddi_setmarkermode">SetMarkerMode</a> function.

## -parameters

### -param hDevice

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### -param Type

A value from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ne-d3dumddi-d3dddi_markertype">D3DDDI_MARKERTYPE</a> enumeration that indicates the type of marker event  that the driver should support.

### -param Flags

A <b>UINT</b> value that indicates whether the driver should provide custom info in command buffers. If set to <b>D3DDDI_SETMARKERMODE_CUSTOMDRIVEREVENTS</b>, the driver should annotate and instrument command buffers with custom event info. Otherwise, the driver should not annotate command buffers.

The annotation can be in the form of a text string in the English-US locale, or in the form of an index value to a location in a string table. For the latter option, the driver must also implement a function that describes the strings that the index values indicate.

## -returns

      Returns <b>S_OK</b> or an appropriate error result if the function does not complete successfully.

## -remarks

Follow these guidelines when you set up profile-type marker events in your user-mode driver, indicated by the <b>D3DDDIMT_PROFILE</b> type:

<ol>
<li>Use lightweight instrumentation that doesn't produce a strong correlation with graphics command boundaries.</li>
<li>The driver must be able to sample the GPU time stamp at the end of the graphics pipeline.</li>
<li>Don't use sampling commands that place a high performance burden on the graphics pipeline, such as wait-for-idle commands. To be able to instrument profile-type marker events, your driver shouldn't have to flush the pipeline or caches.</li>
</ol>
