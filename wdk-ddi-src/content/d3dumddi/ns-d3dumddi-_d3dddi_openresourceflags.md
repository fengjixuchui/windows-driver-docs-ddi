# _D3DDDI_OPENRESOURCEFLAGS structure


## -description


The D3DDDI_OPENRESOURCEFLAGS structure identifies the type of resource to open.


## -struct-fields




### -field Fullscreen

A UINT value that specifies whether the shared primary resource is used with a full-screen device.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field AlphaOverride

A UINT value that specifies whether to use the alpha channel in the shared primary resource. If <b>AlphaOverride</b> is set, the alpha channel should not be used.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 30 bits (0xFFFFFFFC) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_OPENRESOURCEFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies the type of resource to open.
