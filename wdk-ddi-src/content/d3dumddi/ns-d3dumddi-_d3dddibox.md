## -struct-fields




### -field Left

[in] The position of the left side of the box on the x-axis.


### -field Top

[in] The position of the top of the box on the y-axis.


### -field Right

[in] The position of the right side of the box on the x-axis.


### -field Bottom

[in] The position of the bottom of the box on the y-axis.


### -field Front


      [in] The position of the front of the box on the z-axis.


### -field Back

[in] The position of the back of the box on the z-axis.


## -remarks



The height of the volume equals the value in the <b>Bottom</b> member minus the value in the <b>Top</b> member (that is, height = bottom – top). 

The width of the volume equals the value in the <b>Right</b> member minus the value in the <b>Left</b> member (that is, width = right – left). 

The depth of the volume equals the value in the <b>Back</b> member minus the value in the <b>Front</b> member (that is, depth = back – front).
