# PFND3DDDI_OPENRESOURCE callback function


## -description


The <i>OpenResource</i> function informs the driver that a shared resource is opened.


## -parameters




### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context) that is used to open the resource.


### -param *

*pResource* [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_openresource">D3DDDIARG_OPENRESOURCE</a> structure that describes the resource that is opened.


## -returns



<i>OpenResource</i> returns S_OK or an appropriate error result if the resource is not successfully opened.




## -remarks



The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>OpenResource</i> function to inform the user-mode display driver that a shared resource is opened. The driver should store any information that is required to describe the resource and return a unique handle in the <b>hResource</b> member of the D3DDDIARG_OPENRESOURCE structure (pointed to by the <i>pResource</i> parameter) that identifies the new resource in subsequent calls that the Direct3D runtime makes to the driver. The private driver data that is passed to <i>OpenResource</i> is the same private driver data that was passed to the display miniport driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function when the resource was created.

For more information about creating and destroying resources, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/handling-resource-creation-and-destruction">Handling Resource Creation and Destruction</a>.
