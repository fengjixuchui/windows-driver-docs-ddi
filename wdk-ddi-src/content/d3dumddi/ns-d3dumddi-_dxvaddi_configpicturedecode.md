# _DXVADDI_CONFIGPICTUREDECODE structure


## -description

The DXVADDI_CONFIGPICTUREDECODE structure describes the configuration for compressed picture decoding.

## -struct-fields

### -field guidConfigBitstreamEncryption

[in] The encryption GUID for configuring a bitstream.

### -field guidConfigMBcontrolEncryption

[in] The encryption GUID for configuring macroblock control.

### -field guidConfigResidDiffEncryption

[in] The encryption GUID for configuring residual difference decoding.

### -field ConfigBitstreamRaw

[in] The bitstream processing indicator. A value of 1 in this member indicates that picture data is sent in bitstream buffers as raw bitstream content. A value of zero indicates that picture data is sent by using macroblock control command buffers. 

Set this member to zero if the <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> or <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> member is 1. A value of zero in <b>ConfigBitstreamRaw </b>is the basic level of support. The value of 1 is preferred.

### -field ConfigMBcontrolRasterOrder

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether macroblock control commands are in raster scan order or in arbitrary order. A value of 1 in this member specifies that the macroblock control commands within each macroblock control command buffer are in raster scan order. A value of zero indicates arbitrary order. A driver can restrict support to raster scan order; however, a driver should support both arbitrary and raster scan order.

### -field ConfigResidDiffHost

[in] The host residual difference configuration. A value of 1 in this member specifies that some residual difference decoding data is possibly sent as blocks in the spatial domain from the host. A value of zero specifies that spatial domain data is not sent. Set this member to zero if the <b>ConfigBitstreamRaw</b> member is 1. An accelerator should support both zero and 1.

### -field ConfigSpatialResid8

[in] The word size that is used to represent residual difference spatial-domain blocks for predicted (nonintra) pictures when using host-based residual difference decoding (that is, when the <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> member is set to 1).

If <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> is 1 and <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is 1, the host sends residual difference spatial-domain blocks for nonintra macroblocks that use 8-bit signed samples and for intra macroblocks in predicted (nonintra) pictures in a format that depends on the <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> member as follows:

<ul>
<li>
If <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is zero, spatial-domain blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as 8-bit signed integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of 128.

</li>
<li>
If <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is 1, spatial-domain blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as 8-bit unsigned integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of zero.

</li>
</ul>
If <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> is zero and <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is 1, the host sends residual difference spatial-domain blocks of data for nonintra macroblocks that use 16-bit signed samples and for intra macroblocks in predicted (nonintra) pictures in a format that depends on <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> as follows:

<ul>
<li>
If <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is zero, spatial domain blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as 16-bit signed integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of 2<sup>(BPP-1)</sup>, where <i>BPP</i> is the number of bits per sample for the uncompressed video (generally a value of 8).

</li>
<li>
If <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is 1, spatial domain blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as 16-bit unsigned integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of zero.

</li>
</ul>
<b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> must be zero if <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is zero. If <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is 1, <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> can be any value.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    For <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/">intra pictures</a> with <i>BPP</i> equal to 8, spatial-domain blocks must be sent by using 8-bit samples. For intra pictures with <i>BPP</i> greater than 8, spatial-domain blocks must be sent by using 16-bit samples. <p class="note">If <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is zero, these samples are sent as signed integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of 2<sup>(BPP-1)</sup>. If <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is 1, these samples are sent as unsigned integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of zero.

</div>
<div> </div>

### -field ConfigResid8Subtraction

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether 8-bit difference overflow blocks are subtracted or added. If this member is set to 1, 8-bit difference overflow blocks are subtracted rather than added. This member must be zero unless <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> is 1. If <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> is 1, the preferred value for <b>ConfigResid8Subtraction</b> is 1. The ability to subtract differences rather than to add them enables 8-bit difference decoding to be fully compliant with the range from -255 through +255 of values that are required in video decoder specifications. This ability enables full compliance because +255 cannot be represented as the addition of two signed 8-bit numbers but any number in the range from -255 through +255 can be represented as the difference between two signed 8-bit numbers (+255 is equal to +127 minus âˆ’128).

### -field ConfigSpatialHost8or9Clipping

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether clipping is performed by the host. If this member set to 1, spatial-domain blocks for intra macroblocks are clipped to an 8-bit range on the host and spatial-domain blocks for nonintra macroblocks are clipped to a 9-bit range on the host. A value of zero indicates that no such clipping is performed by the host. This member must be zero unless <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> is set to zero and <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is set to 1. The preferred value for <b>ConfigSpatialHost8or9Clipping</b> is zero.

### -field ConfigSpatialResidInterleaved

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether spatial-domain residual difference data is sent in a chrominance-interleaved form. If this member is set to 1, any spatial-domain residual difference data is sent in a chrominance-interleaved form that matches the YUV format chrominance interleaving pattern. This member must be zero unless <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is 1 and the YUV format is NV12 or NV21. The preferred value for <b>ConfigSpatialResidInterleaved</b> is zero.

### -field ConfigIntraResidUnsigned

[in] The method of representation of spatial-domain blocks of residual difference data for intra blocks when using host-based difference decoding (that is, when the <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> member is equal to 1).

If <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is set to zero and <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is set to 1, spatial-domain residual difference data blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as follows:

<ul>
<li>
In a nonintra picture if the <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> member is zero, the spatial-domain residual difference data blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as 16-bit signed integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of 2<sup>(BPP-1)</sup>, where <i>BPP</i> is the number of bits per sample for the uncompressed video (generally a value of 8).

</li>
<li>
In a nonintra picture if <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> is 1 and in an intra picture if <i>BPP</i> is equal to 8 (regardless of the value of <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b>), the spatial-domain residual difference data blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as 8-bit signed integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of 128.

</li>
</ul>
If <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is set to 1 and <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is set to 1, spatial-domain residual difference data blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as follows:

<ul>
<li>
In a nonintra picture if <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> is zero, the spatial-domain residual difference data blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as 16-bit unsigned integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of zero.

</li>
<li>
In a nonintra picture if <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b> is 1 and in an intra picture if <i>BPP</i> is equal to 8 (regardless of the value of <b>ConfigSpatialResid8</b>), the spatial-domain residual difference data blocks for intra macroblocks are sent as 8-bit unsigned integer values that are relative to a constant reference value of zero.

</li>
</ul>
<b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> must be zero unless <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is 1. The preferred value for <b>ConfigIntraResidUnsigned</b> is zero.

### -field ConfigResidDiffAccelerator

[in] The accelerator residual difference configuration. A value of 1 in this member indicates that transform-domain blocks of coefficient data can be sent from the host for accelerator-based IDCT. A value of zero indicates that accelerator-based IDCT is not used. 

If both the <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> member and <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> are 1, some residual difference decoding is performed on the host and some on the accelerator, as indicated by macroblock-level control commands. <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> must be zero if the <b>bConfigBitstreamRaw</b> member is 1. 

The preferred value for <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> is 1.

If <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> and <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> are set to 1, residual difference decoding can be shared between the host and accelerator on a macroblock basis. This sharing is an even higher level of accelerator capability than when <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> is set to 1 and <b>ConfigResidDiffHost</b> is set to zero.

### -field ConfigHostInverseScan

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the inverse scan for transform-domain block processing is performed on the host or the accelerator. A value of 1 in this member indicates that the inverse scan for transform-domain block processing is performed on the host, and absolute indexes are sent instead for any transform coefficients. A value of zero indicates that inverse scan is performed on the accelerator. <b>ConfigHostInverseScan</b> must be zero if <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> is zero or if the <b>Config4GroupedCoefs</b> member is 1.

The preferred value for <b>ConfigHostInverseScan</b> is 1 if <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> is 1.

### -field ConfigSpecificIDCT

[in] A UINT value that specifies the use of a specific <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/">IDCT</a> method for off-host IDCT. A value of 1 in this member indicates the use of the IDCT that is specified in Annex W of ITU-T Recommendation H.263, which you can learn about from the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8741">International Telecommunication Union</a> website. A value of zero indicates that any compliant IDCT can be used for off-host IDCT. (Values other than zero and 1 are reserved.)

<b>ConfigSpecificIDCT</b> must be zero if <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> is zero, which indicates host-based residual difference decoding.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <b>ConfigSpecificIDCT</b> must not be set to 1 for use with MPEG-2 video. </div>
<div> </div>

### -field Config4GroupedCoefs

[in] A UINT value that specifies how transform coefficients for off-host IDCT are sent. A value of 1 in this member indicates that transform coefficients for off-host IDCT are sent by using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dxva/ns-dxva-_dxva_tcoef4group">DXVA_TCoef4Group</a> structure rather than the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dxva/ns-dxva-_dxva_tcoefsingle">DXVA_TCoefSingle</a> structure. <b>Config4GroupedCoefs</b> is zero if <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> is zero or if <b>ConfigHostInverseScan</b> is 1.

The preferred value for <b>Config4GroupedCoefs</b> is zero if <b>ConfigResidDiffAccelerator</b> is 1.

### -field ConfigMinRenderTargetBuffCount

[in] A USHORT value that specifies the minimum number of render target buffers.

### -field ConfigDecoderSpecific

[in] A USHORT value that specifies decoder-specific features to configure. For information about a decoder's features, see the specification for that decoder. For a list of decoders, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/providing-capabilities-for-video-decoding">Providing Capabilities for Video Decoding</a>.
