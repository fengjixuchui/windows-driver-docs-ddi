# D3DDDIARG_CHECKPRESENTDURATIONSUPPORT structure


## -description

Used in a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_checkpresentdurationsupport">CheckPresentDurationSupport</a> function to check details on hardware device support for seamlessly switching to a new monitor refresh rate.

## -struct-fields

### -field VidPnSourceId

[in] The zero-based video present network (VidPN) source identification number of the input for which the hardware support is queried.

### -field DesiredPresentDuration

[in] The desired duration of a single present operation, in units of 100 nanoseconds.

### -field ClosestSmallerDuration

[out] The smallest supported desired duration of a single present operation on the given VidPN source, in units of 100 nanoseconds. The value must be ≤ <b>DesiredPresentDuration</b>.

See Remarks for more limitations on this value.

### -field ClosestLargerDuration

[out] The largest supported desired duration of a single present operation on the given VidPN source, in units of 100 nanoseconds. The value must be ≥ <b>DesiredPresentDuration</b>.

See Remarks for more limitations on this value.

## -remarks

Either  <b>ClosestSmallerDuration</b> or <b>ClosestLargerDuration</b> can be zero. However, if both  are zero, the device cannot seamlessly switch to a new refresh rate.

If both <b>ClosestSmallerDuration</b> and <b>ClosestLargerDuration</b> have the same value as <b>DesiredPresentDuration</b>, the device can precisely match <b>DesiredPresentDuration</b>.

The difference between <b>DesiredPresentDuration</b> and <b>ClosestSmallerDuration</b> (or <b>ClosestLargerDuration</b>) represents the driver’s knowledge of the device capabilities, but there will be additional error during execution. The final accuracy of the device when using per-present durations should typically be the same as the accuracy using  existing presentation modes.
