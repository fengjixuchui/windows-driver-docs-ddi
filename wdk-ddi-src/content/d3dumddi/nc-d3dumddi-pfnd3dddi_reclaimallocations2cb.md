# PFND3DDDI_RECLAIMALLOCATIONS2CB callback function


## -description


<b>pfnReclaimAllocations2Cb</b> is called by the user mode driver   to reclaim video memory allocations that were previously offered  for reuse.


## -parameters


### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device.


### -param *


*pData* [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_reclaimallocations2">D3DDDICB_RECLAIMALLOCATIONS2</a> structure that defines the allocations to reclaim.


## -returns

Returns one of the following values.

| **Return code** | **Description** | 
|:--|:--|
| **S_OK** | The allocations were successfully reclaimed. | 
| **E_INVALIDARG** | An invalid parameter was supplied. | 
| **D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED** | The video memory manager or display miniport driver could not complete the operation because either a Plug and Play (PnP) Stop event or a Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) event occurred.
Note  If this error code is returned, the driver's calling function (typically the [pfnReclaimResources](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/dxgiddi/ns-dxgiddi-dxgi1_2_ddi_base_functions)  routine) must return this error code to the Direct3D runtime. |
