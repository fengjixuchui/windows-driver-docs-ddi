# _D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE2 structure


## -description


The D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE2 structure describes an indexed primitive to draw. 


## -struct-fields




### -field PrimitiveType

[in] A D3DPRIMITIVETYPE-typed value that indicates the type of primitive to draw. This member can be one of the following values: D3DPT_POINTLIST, D3DPT_LINELIST, D3DPT_LINESTRIP, D3DPT_TRIANGLELIST, D3DPT_TRIANGLESTRIP, or D3DPT_TRIANGLEFAN. For more information about D3DPRIMITIVETYPE, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.


### -field BaseVertexOffset

[in] The offset that should be added to each vertex in vertex stream 0 by the various primitives to determine the actual vertex in vertex stream 0. This offset could be negative, but when an index is added to the offset, the result is positive. 


### -field MinIndex

[in] The minimum index of a range of vertices that are potentially accessed by the primitives to be drawn and, therefore, which vertices should be processed.


### -field NumVertices

[in] The number of vertices in a range that are potentially accessed by the primitives to be drawn and, therefore, which vertices should be processed.


### -field StartIndexOffset

[in] The offset of the first index in the index buffer from which indices are read to draw the primitives.


### -field PrimitiveCount

[in] The number of triangles, lines, or points to draw for the given primitive. 


## -remarks



The Microsoft Direct3D runtime transforms the index data before passing a pointer to the description of the index data in the <i>pData</i> parameter in a call to the user-mode display driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawindexedprimitive2">DrawIndexedPrimitive2</a> function. 

When the runtime specifies triangle-edge flags in the value that is pointed to by the <i>pFlagBuffer</i> parameter in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_drawindexedprimitive2">DrawIndexedPrimitive2</a> call, the runtime also specifies to draw only one triangle (that is, the runtime specifies the D3DPT_TRIANGLELIST value in the <b>PrimitiveType</b> member and 0x00000001 in the <b>PrimitiveCount</b> member of D3DDDIARG_DRAWINDEXEDPRIMITIVE2 that is pointed to by the <i>pData</i> parameter in the <b>DrawIndexedPrimitive2</b> call).
