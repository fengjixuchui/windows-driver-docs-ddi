# _DXVADDI_VIDEOSAMPLEFLAGS structure


## -description

The DXVADDI_VIDEOSAMPLEFLAGS structure identifies changes in the current sample frame from the previous sample frame.

## -struct-fields

### -field PaletteChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the palette of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).

### -field SrcRectChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the source rectangle of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).

### -field DstRectChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the destination rectangle of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).

### -field ColorDataChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the color data of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).

### -field PlanarAlphaChanged

A UINT value that specifies whether the alpha (transparency) data of the sample frame changed. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the sixth through sixteenth bits (0x0000FFE0) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.

### -field SampleData

A UINT value that contains video sample data. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the seventeenth through thirty-second bits (0xFFFF0000) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member. The following bits can be set:

DXVADDI_SAMPLEDATA_RFF (0x0001)

DXVADDI_SAMPLEDATA_TFF (0x0002)

DXVADDI_SAMPLEDATA_RFF_TFF_PRESENT (0x0004)

### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in DXVADDI_VIDEOSAMPLEFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies changes in the current sample frame from the previous sample frame.
