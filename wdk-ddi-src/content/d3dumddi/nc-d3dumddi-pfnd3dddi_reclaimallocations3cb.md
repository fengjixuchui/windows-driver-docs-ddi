# PFND3DDDI_RECLAIMALLOCATIONS3CB callback function


## -description

<b>pfnReclaimAllocations3Cb</b> is called by the user mode driver   to reclaim video memory allocations that were previously offered  for reuse.

## -parameters

### -param hDevice

A handle to the display device.

### -param Arg2

*pData* [in, out]

A pointer to a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_reclaimallocations3cb">D3DDDICB_RECLAIMALLOCATIONS3</a> structure that defines the allocations to reclaim. The previously used discarded array is replaced by a pResults member in this iteration.

## -returns

Returns one of the following values.

| **Return code** | **Description** | 
|:--|:--|
| **S_OK** | The allocations were successfully reclaimed. | 
| **E_INVALIDARG** | An invalid parameter was supplied. | 
| **D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED** | The video memory manager or display miniport driver could not complete the operation because either a Plug and Play (PnP) Stop event or a Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) event occurred.<br.>**Note:** If this error code is returned, the driver's calling function (typically the [pfnReclaimResources](../dxgiddi/ns-dxgiddi-dxgi1_2_ddi_base_functions.md)  routine) must return this error code to the Direct3D runtime. |
