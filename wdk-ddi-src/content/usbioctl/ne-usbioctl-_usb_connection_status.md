# _USB_CONNECTION_STATUS enumeration


## -description


The <b>USB_CONNECTION_STATUS</b> enumerator indicates the status of the connection to a device on a USB hub port.


## -enum-fields




### -field NoDeviceConnected

Indicates that there is no device connected to the port.


### -field DeviceConnected

Indicates that a device was successfully connected to the port.


### -field DeviceFailedEnumeration

Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but the enumeration of the device failed.


### -field DeviceGeneralFailure

Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but the connection failed for unspecified reasons.


### -field DeviceCausedOvercurrent

Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but the attempt failed because of an overcurrent condition.


### -field DeviceNotEnoughPower

Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but there was not enough power to drive the device, and the connection failed.


### -field DeviceNotEnoughBandwidth

Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but there was not enough bandwidth available for the device to function properly, and the connection failed.


### -field DeviceHubNestedTooDeeply

Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port, but the nesting of USB hubs was too deep, so the connection failed. 


### -field DeviceInLegacyHub

Indicates that an attempt was made to connect a device to the port of an unsupported legacy hub, and the connection failed.


### -field DeviceEnumerating

Indicates that a device connected to the port is currently being enumerated.  

<b>Note</b>  This constant is supported in Windows Vista and later operating systems.


### -field DeviceReset

Indicates that device connected to the port is currently being reset.  

<b>Note</b>  This constant is supported in Windows Vista and later operating systems.


## -remarks



The USB bus driver reports connection status in a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/usbioctl/ns-usbioctl-_usb_node_connection_information_ex">USB_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX</a> structure in response to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/usbioctl/ni-usbioctl-ioctl_usb_get_node_connection_information_ex">IOCTL_USB_GET_NODE_CONNECTION_INFORMATION_EX</a> request.
