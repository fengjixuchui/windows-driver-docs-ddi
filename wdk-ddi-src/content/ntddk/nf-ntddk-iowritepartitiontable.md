# IoWritePartitionTable function


## -description


The <b>IoWritePartitionTable</b> routine is <b>obsolete</b> and is provided only to support existing drivers. New drivers must use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-iowritepartitiontableex">IoWritePartitionTableEx</a>.

<b>IoWritePartitionTable</b> writes partition tables from the entries in the partition list buffer for each partition on the disk represented by the given device object.


## -parameters




### -param DeviceObject [in]

Pointer to the device object representing the disk whose partition tables are to be written.


### -param SectorSize [in]

Specifies the size in bytes of sectors on the device.


### -param SectorsPerTrack [in]

Specifies the track size on the device.


### -param NumberOfHeads [in]

Specifies the number of tracks per cylinder.


### -param PartitionBuffer [in]

Pointer to the drive layout buffer that contains the partition list entries. For more detailed information see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntdddisk/ns-ntdddisk-_drive_layout_information">DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION</a>.


## -returns



<b>IoWritePartitionTablo</b> returns a status code of STATUS_SUCCESS if all writes were completed without error. In case of failure, the error codes returned by <b>IoWritePartitionTable</b> might include, but are not limited to, the following list:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates a failure read the correct disk geometry.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates a failure to allocate necessary resources (for example, heap memory, IRPs, etc.).

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that sector zero did not have the expected MBR disk signature.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



<b>IoWritePartitionTable</b> must only be used by disk drivers. Other drivers should use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntdddisk/ni-ntdddisk-ioctl_disk_set_drive_layout">IOCTL_DISK_SET_DRIVE_LAYOUT</a> disk I/O request instead.

<b>IoWritePartitionTable</b> is called when a disk device driver is requested to set the partition type in a partition table entry or to repartition the disk by an IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request. The device control request is generally issued by the format utility, which performs I/O control functions on the partitions and disks in the machine.

To reset a partition type, the driver passes a pointer to the device object representing the physical disk and the number of the partition associated with the device object that the format utility has open. When a disk is to be repartitioned dynamically, the disk driver must tear down its set of device objects representing the current disk partitions and create a new set of device objects representing the new partitions on the disk.

Applications that create and delete partitions and require full descriptions of the system should call <b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> with <i>ReturnRecognizedPartitions</i> set to <b>FALSE</b>. The drive layout structure can be modified by the system format utility to reflect a new configuration of the disk.

<b>IoWritePartitionTable</b> is synchronous. It must be called by the disk driver's Dispatch routine or by a driver thread. Thus, all user and file system threads must be prepared to enter a wait state when issuing the device control request to reset partition types for the device.
