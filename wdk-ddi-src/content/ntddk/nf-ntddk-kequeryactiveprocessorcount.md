# KeQueryActiveProcessorCount function


## -description


The <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> routine returns the number of currently active processors.


## -parameters




### -param ActiveProcessors [out, optional]

A pointer to a [**KAFFINITY**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/interrupt-affinity-and-priority#about-kaffinity)-typed variable into which the routine writes a bitmask that represents the set of currently active processors. In a hot-add environment, this mask may change during runtime. This parameter is optional and can be specified as <b>NULL</b> if the caller does not require the mask of active processors. 


## -returns



<b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> returns the number of currently active processors. 




## -remarks



A device driver calls the <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> routine to retrieve the number of currently active processors. Device drivers that are built for Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system should not use the <b>KeNumberProcessors</b> kernel variable for this purpose.

Callers cannot assume that the <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> routine maps processors to bits in the returned [**KAFFINITY**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/interrupt-affinity-and-priority#about-kaffinity) value consecutively, or that the routine will return the same bitmask each time it is called.

Callers must also be aware that the value returned by <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> can change at runtime on versions of Windows that support hot-add CPU functionality.

If necessary, register for notification of changes to the number of processors by calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-keregisterprocessorchangecallback">KeRegisterProcessorChangeCallback</a> routine.

To query just the affinity mask without getting the number of active processors, use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kequeryactiveprocessors">KeQueryActiveProcessors</a>.

Windows 7 and later versions of Windows support processor groups. Drivers that are designed to handle information about processor groups should use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-kequeryactiveprocessorcountex">KeQueryActiveProcessorCountEx</a> routine, which specifies a processor group, instead of <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b>, which does not. However, the implementation of <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> in Windows 7 and later versions of Windows provides compatibility for drivers that were written for earlier versions of Windows, which do not support processor groups. In this implementation, <b>KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</b> returns the number of active logical processors in group 0, and writes an affinity mask to *<i>ActiveProcessors</i> that specifies the set of active logical processors in group 0.
