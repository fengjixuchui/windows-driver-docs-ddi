# _WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure describes a bank of machine check registers for an x86 or x64 processor.


## -struct-fields




### -field BankNumber

The processor machine check register bank number.


### -field ClearOnInitialization

A Boolean value that indicates that the status registers for the bank are to be cleared by the operating system during initialization.


### -field StatusDataFormat

The format of the data in the register bank's status register. Possible values are:





#### WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_STATUSFORMAT_IA32MCA

IA32 machine check architecture.



#### WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_STATUSFORMAT_Intel64MCA

Intel64 machine check architecture.



#### WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_STATUSFORMAT_AMD64MCA

AMD64 machine check architecture.


### -field Flags

An XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS union that indicates which of the members of the WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure can be written to by the operating system. The XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS union is defined as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef union _XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS {
  struct {
    UCHAR  ClearOnInitializationRW:1;
    UCHAR  ControlDataRW:1;
    UCHAR  Reserved:6;
  };
  UCHAR  AsUCHAR;
} XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS, *PXPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>




#### ClearOnInitializationRW

A single bit that indicates that the operating system can write to the <b>ClearOnInitialization</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure.



#### ControlDataRW

A single bit that indicates that the operating system can write to the <b>ControlData</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR structure.



#### Reserved

Reserved for system use.



#### AsUCHAR

A UCHAR representation of contents of the XPF_MC_BANK_FLAGS union.


### -field ControlMsr

The model-specific register address of the register bank's IA32_MCi_CTL register. For more information about the IA32_MCi_CTL register, see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field StatusMsr

The model-specific register address of the register bank's IA32_MCi_STATUS register. For more information about the IA32_MCi_STATUS register, see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field AddressMsr

The model-specific register address of the register bank's IA32_MCi_ADDR register. For more information about the IA32_MCi_ADDR register, see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field MiscMsr

The model-specific register address of the register bank's IA32_MCi_MISC register. For more information about the IA32_MCi_MISC register, see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field ControlData

The value that the operating system writes to the register bank's control register during initialization.
