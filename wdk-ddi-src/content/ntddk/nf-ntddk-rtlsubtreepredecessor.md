# RtlSubtreePredecessor function


## -description


The <b>RtlSubtreePredecessor</b> routine returns a pointer to the predecessor of the specified node within the subtree that is rooted at that node. 


## -parameters




### -param Links [in]

A pointer to the node. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>. 


## -returns



<b>RtlSubtreePredecessor</b> returns a pointer to the subtree predecessor of the node at <i>Links</i>, or <b>NULL</b> if the node has no subtree predecessor. 




## -remarks



If the node at <i>Links</i> has a left subtree, the rightmost node of that subtree is the subtree predecessor. 

Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlSubtreePredecessor</b> must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the tree is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
