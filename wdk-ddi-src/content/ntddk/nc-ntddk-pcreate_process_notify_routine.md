# PCREATE_PROCESS_NOTIFY_ROUTINE callback function


## -description

Process-creation callback implemented by a driver  to track the system-wide creation and deletion of processes against the driver's internal state.
<div class="alert"><b>Warning</b>  The actions that  you can perform in this routine are restricted for safe calls. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/windows-kernel-mode-process-and-thread-manager#best">Best Practices</a>. </div><div> </div>

## -parameters

### -param ParentId 

[in]
The process ID of the parent process.

### -param ProcessId 

[in]
The process ID of the process.

### -param Create 

[in]
Indicates whether the process was created (<b>TRUE</b>) or deleted (<b>FALSE</b>).

## -remarks

Highest-level drivers call <b>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</b> to register their process-creation notify routines.

A driver's process-notify routine is also called with <i>Create</i> set to <b>FALSE</b>, typically when the last thread within a process has terminated and the process address space is about to be deleted.

 The operating system calls the driver's process-notify routine at PASSIVE_LEVEL inside a critical region with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/types-of-apcs">normal kernel APCs</a> disabled. When a process is created, the process-notify routine runs in the context of the thread that created the new process. When a process is deleted, the process-notify routine runs in the context of the last thread to exit from the process.
