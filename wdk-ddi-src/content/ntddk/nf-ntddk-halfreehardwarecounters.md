# HalFreeHardwareCounters function


## -description


The <b>HalFreeHardwareCounters</b> routine frees a set of hardware performance counter resources that was acquired in a previous call to [**HalAllocateHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md) routine.


## -syntax


```cpp
NTSTATUS HalFreeHardwareCounters(
  _In_ HANDLE CounterSetHandle
);
```


## -parameters




### -param CounterSetHandle [in]

A handle to the allocated counter resources. The caller acquired this handle in a previous call to [**HalAllocateHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md).


## -returns



<b>HalFreeHardwareCounters</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Possible error return values include the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Parameter <i>CounterSetHandle</i> is not a valid counter resources handle.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 

## -remarks

Before calling this function, the client driver is expected to stop and clear the associated counter resources.
