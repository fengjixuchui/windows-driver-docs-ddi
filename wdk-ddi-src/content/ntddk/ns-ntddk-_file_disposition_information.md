# _FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION structure


## -description


The <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION</b> structure is used as an argument to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntifs/nf-ntifs-ntsetinformationfile">ZwSetInformationFile</a> routine.


## -struct-fields




### -field DeleteFile

Indicates whether the operating system file should delete the file when the file is closed. Set this member to <b>TRUE</b> to delete the file when it is closed. Otherwise, set to <b>FALSE</b>. Setting this member to <b>FALSE</b> has no effect if the handle was opened with FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE.


## -remarks



The caller must have DELETE access to a given file in order to call <b>ZwSetInformationFile</b> with <b>DeleteFile</b> set to <b>TRUE</b> in this structure. Subsequently, the only legal operation by such a caller is to close the open file handle. 

A file marked for deletion is not actually deleted until all open handles for the file object have been closed and the link count for the file is zero.
