# _PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes the counter resources available on the platform.


## -struct-fields




### -field Type

Indicates the type of counter resource described by the structure. Set this parameter to one of the following [**PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE**](ne-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor_type.md) enumeration constants:

<ul>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeSingle</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeRange</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeOverflow</b>

</li>
<li>
<b>ResourceTypeEventBuffer</b>

</li>
</ul>

### -field Flags

No flags are currently defined. Set this member to zero.


### -field u

A union that can contain a <b>CounterIndex</b>, <b>Range</b>, <b>OverflowHandler</b>, or <b>EventBufferConfiguration</b> value.


### -field u.CounterIndex

A physical counter index.


### -field u.Range.Begin

The starting counter index of a block of contiguous counters.


### -field u.Range.End

The ending counter index of a block of contiguous counters.


### -field u.Range

A range of counter indexes.


### -field u.OverflowHandler

A pointer to the driver-supplied [*PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_OVERFLOW_HANDLER*](nc-ntddk-pphysical_counter_overflow_handler.md) routine that will be called when an associated hardware counter (specified by another <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b>) overflows.


### -field u.EventBufferConfiguration

A configuration for event buffer based sampling (such as Intel's PEBS). The configuration fields are defined by the [PHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_CONFIGURATION](ns-ntddk-physical_counter_event_buffer_configuration.md) type.


## -remarks



Most processors have performance monitor units that contain a number of hardware counters for measuring various aspects of system performance. The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure describes a counter resource, which can be a single hardware counter, a block of contiguous counters, a counter overflow interrupt, or an event buffer configuration. This structure's <b>Type</b> member indicates which type of counter resource is described by the structure.

To specify a set of counter resources, a kernel-mode client can provide an array of <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structures. A [**PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST**](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_list.md) structure serves as a header for the array. The client can allocate and free the set of counter resources described by the array as a single unit. To do so, the driver calls [**HalAllocateHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md) and [**HalFreeHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halfreehardwarecounters.md)
