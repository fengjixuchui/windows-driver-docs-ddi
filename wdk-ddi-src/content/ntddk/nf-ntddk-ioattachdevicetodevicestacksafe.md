# IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe function


## -description


The <b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> routine attaches the caller's device object to the topmost device object in a driver stack. 


## -parameters




### -param SourceDevice [in]

Pointer to a caller-created device object. 


### -param TargetDevice [in]

Pointer to the device object in the stack to which the <i>SourceDevice</i> object is to be attached. 


### -param AttachedToDeviceObject [out]

On input, this parameter specifies the address of <i>SourceDevice->DeviceExtension->AttachedToDeviceObject</i>, which must contain a <b>NULL</b> pointer. On output, this parameter receives a pointer to the device object to which the <i>SourceDevice</i> was attached. 


## -returns



<b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if <i>SourceDevice</i> is successfully attached above the <i>TargetDevice</i>; otherwise it returns STATUS_NO_SUCH_DEVICE. 




## -remarks



Like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-ioattachdevicetodevicestack">IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack</a>, <b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> establishes layering between drivers so that the same IRPs are sent to each driver in the stack. However, unlike <b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStack</b>, <b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> has an additional parameter, <i>AttachedToDeviceObject</i>, which the filter driver uses to pass the address of the <i>SourceDevice</i> object's AttachedToDeviceObject field. <b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> updates this field while holding the I/O system database lock. Because it holds this lock, <b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> avoids a race condition that could otherwise occur if the <i>SourceDevice</i> object received an IRP before its AttachedToDeviceObject field was updated. 

A file system filter driver calls <b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> to attach its own filter device object (<i>SourceDevice</i>) above a device object (<i>TargetDevice</i>) belonging to a file system or another filter driver. Subsequent I/O requests sent to <i>AttachedToDeviceObject</i> are received first by the filter driver, which processes them and forwards them down to the next driver in the stack by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-iocalldriver">IoCallDriver</a>. 

If the device object specified by <i>TargetDevice</i> is currently at the top of the driver stack, the <i>SourceDevice</i> is attached directly to the <i>TargetDevice</i>. In this case, <i>TargetDevice</i> and the returned <i>AttachedToDeviceObject</i> pointer are equal. 

If one or more filter device objects are already attached above the <i>TargetDevice</i> in the driver stack, <b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> attaches the <i>SourceDevice</i> to the topmost filter device object. A pointer to the latter is returned in <i>AttachedToDeviceObject</i>. 

At the moment immediately after it is attached to the top of the stack, the <i>SourceDevice</i> occupies the top of the driver stack. Note, however, that this does not necessarily mean that the <i>SourceDevice</i> will remain at the top of the driver stack. Other filters can attach their own filter device objects above the <i>SourceDevice</i> in the stack. 

<b>IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe</b> sets the <b>AlignmentRequirement</b> member of the device object pointed to by <i>SourceDevice</i> to the value of the corresponding in the next-lower device object and sets the <b>StackSize</b> in <i>SourceDevice</i> to the value in the next-lower-object plus one.
