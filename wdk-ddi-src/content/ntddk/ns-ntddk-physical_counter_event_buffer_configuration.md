# PHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_CONFIGURATION structure

## -description

The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_CONFIGURATION</b> structure describes the configuration for event buffers on the platform.

## -struct-fields

### -field OverflowHandler

A pointer to the driver-supplied [*PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_HANDLER](nc-ntddk-pphysical_counter_event_buffer_overflow_handler.md) routine that will be called when the event buffer entries reach a threshold in the event buffer.


### -field CustomEventBufferEntrySize

The size of the event buffer entries, for custom event buffer sizes. Set to zero.


### -field EventThreshold

The number of events to be recorded before the OverflowHandler callback routine is invoked. This value is used as a maximum threshold. The actual number of events will depend on the number of actors using event buffer profiling.

## -remarks

Most processors have performance monitor units that contain a number of hardware counters for measuring various aspects of system performance. The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_CONFIGURATION</b> structure is used within the [**PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR**](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md) structure to describe the configuration for event buffer resources.
