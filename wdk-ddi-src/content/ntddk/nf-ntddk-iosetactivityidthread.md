# IoSetActivityIdThread function


## -description


The IoSetActivityIdThread routine associates an activity ID with the current thread. Drivers should use this routine when they are tracing aware and are issuing I/O on a worker thread.


## -parameters




### -param ActivityId

The activity ID provided by caller.


## -returns



The activity ID that was previously set on the thread. Drivers must call IoClearActivityIdThread with this pointer when tracing is completed within the same thread context.




## -remarks



Drivers that use  I/O work items do not need to call this routine because the I/O subsystem takes care of propagating activity IDs to threads in that case.
