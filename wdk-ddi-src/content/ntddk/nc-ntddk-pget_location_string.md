# PGET_LOCATION_STRING callback function


## -description


The <i>PnpGetLocationString</i> routine provides the device-specific part of the device's SPDRP_LOCATION_PATHS property.


## -parameters




### -param Context [in, out]

A pointer to interface-specific context information.  The caller passes the value that is passed as the <b>Context</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/ns-ntddk-_pnp_location_interface">PNP_LOCATION_INTERFACE</a> structure.


### -param *LocationStrings [out]

A pointer to a sequence of null-terminated Unicode strings, that is terminated by another zero. Each string serves as a location string for the device. Drivers typically return a single string.


## -returns



The routine returns an NTSTATUS value to indicate the status of the operation.




## -remarks



The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/ns-ntddk-_pnp_location_interface">PNP_LOCATION_INTERFACE</a> structure supplies a pointer to the <i>PnpGetLocationString</i> routine.

The <i>PnpGetLocationString</i> routine provides the device-specific part of the location string for the device.  The Plug and Play (PnP) manager assembles the location string for a device by querying the driver for the device, for the device's bus, and any parent buses, and concatenating the provided strings together.

The routine must return a string that is unique to the device relative to its bus. The string must be the same for the device across all versions of the operating system. Once you select a string for this purpose, you must not change it.

By convention, the location string takes the form <i>ServiceName(BusSpecificLocation)</i>. For example, PCI devices use PCI(<i>XXYY</i>), where <i>XX</i> is the device number, and <i>YY</i> is the function number.

The <i>PnpGetLocationString</i> routine calls a routine such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag">ExAllocatePoolWithTag</a> to allocate the memory for the location string. The caller is responsible for calling the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/nf-ntddk-exfreepool">ExFreePool</a> routine to free the memory pointed to by <i>LocationStrings</i> when the location string is no longer needed.
