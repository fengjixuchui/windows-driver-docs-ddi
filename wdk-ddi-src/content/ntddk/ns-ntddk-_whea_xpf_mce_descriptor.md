# _WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure describes a machine check exception (MCE) error source for an x86 or x64 processor.


## -struct-fields




### -field Type

The type of error source descriptor. This member is always set to WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_XPFMCE.


### -field Enabled

A Boolean value that indicates if the error source is enabled.


### -field NumberOfBanks

The number of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_mc_bank_descriptor">WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures contained in the <b>Banks</b> member.


### -field Flags

An XPF_MCE_FLAGS union that indicates which of the members of the WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure can be written to by the operating system. The XPF_MCE_FLAGS union is defined as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef union _XPF_MCE_FLAGS {
  struct {
    UCHAR  MCG_CapabilityRW:1;
    UCHAR  MCG_GlobalControlRW:1;
    UCHAR  Reserved:30;
  };
  UCHAR  AsULONG;
} XPF_MCE_FLAGS, *PXPF_MCE_FLAGS;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>




#### MCG_CapabilityRW

A single bit that indicates that the operating system can write to the <b>MCG_Capability</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure.



#### MCG_GlobalControlRW

A single bit that indicates that the operating system can write to the <b>MCG_GlobalControl</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure.



#### Reserved

Reserved for system use.



#### AsULONG

A ULONG representation of the contents of the XPF_MCE_FLAGS union.


### -field MCG_Capability

The contents of the processor's IA32_MCG_CAP model-specific register. This register contains capability information about the machine check architecture of the processor. For more information about the IA32_MCG_CAP register, see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field MCG_GlobalControl

The contents of the processor's IA32_MCG_CTL model-specific register. This register controls the reporting of machine check exceptions. For more information about the IA32_MCG_CTL register, see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=78804">Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>.


### -field Banks

An array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_mc_bank_descriptor">WHEA_XPF_MC_BANK_DESCRIPTOR</a> structures that describe the banks of machine check registers.


## -remarks



A WHEA_XPF_MCE_DESCRIPTOR structure is contained within the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/ns-ntddk-_whea_error_source_descriptor">WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> structure.
