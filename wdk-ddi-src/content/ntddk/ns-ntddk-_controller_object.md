# _CONTROLLER_OBJECT structure


## -description


A controller object represents a hardware adapter or controller with homogenous devices that are the actual targets for I/O requests. A controller object can be used to synchronize a device driver's I/O to the target devices through its hardware adapter/controller. 

A controller object is partially opaque. Driver writers must know about a certain field associated with the controller object because their drivers access this field through the controller object pointer returned by <b>IoCreateController</b>. The following field in a controller object is accessible to the creating driver. 


## -struct-fields




### -field Type

 


### -field Size

 


### -field ControllerExtension

Pointer to the controller extension. The structure and contents of the controller extension are driver-defined. The size is driver-determined, specified in the driver's call to <b>IoCreateController</b>. Usually, drivers maintain common state about I/O operations in the controller extension and device-specific state about I/O for a target device in the corresponding device extension. 


### -field DeviceWaitQueue

 


### -field Spare1

 


### -field Spare2

 




## -remarks



Most driver routines that process IRPs are given a pointer to the target device object. Consequently, device drivers that use controller objects frequently store the controller object pointer returned by <b>IoCreateController</b> in each device extension. 

Note that a controller object has no name so it cannot be the target of an I/O request, and higher-level drivers cannot connect or attach their device objects to a device driver's controller object. 

Undocumented fields within a controller object should be considered inaccessible. Drivers with dependencies on object field locations or access to undocumented fields might not remain portable and interoperable with other drivers over time.
