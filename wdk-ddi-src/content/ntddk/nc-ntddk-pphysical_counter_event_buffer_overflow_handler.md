# PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_EVENT_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_HANDLER callback function


## -description

The PPHYSICAL_COUNTER_OVERFLOW_HANDLER is implemented by the client driver to handle event buffer overflows from the counters resources acquired through the [**HalAllocateHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md) routine.

## -parameters

### -param EventBuffer

Provides a pointer to the event buffer containing the event entries.

### -param EntrySize

Provides the size of an individual event entry.

### -param NumberOfEntries

Provides the number of entries available.

### -param OwningHandle

Provides the <b>HANDLE</b> corresponding to the resource set the event buffer belongs to.

## -remarks

Register your implementation of this callback function by calling [**HalAllocateHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md) with a structure of type [**PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST**](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_list.md).  In the **PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_LIST**, provide a structure of type [PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md) that specifies a [**PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE**](ne-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor_type.md) of **ResourceTypeEventBuffer**.

This callback is called at IRQL = PROFILE_LEVEL. This means it must always be memory-resident. The callback should return as quickly as possible and should not attempt to do any of the following.

* Acquire or release spin locks.

* Access paged pool that is not locked in memory

* Call a pageable routine.

The callback does not need to handle clearing any overflow registers as it will be handled by the HAL.
