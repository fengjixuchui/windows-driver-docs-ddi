# IoDeleteController function


## -description


The <b>IoDeleteController</b> routine removes a given controller object from the system, for example, when the driver that created it is being unloaded.


## -parameters




### -param ControllerObject [in]

Pointer to the controller object to be released. 


## -remarks



<b>IoDeleteController</b> deallocates the memory for the controller object, including the controller extension.

This routine must be called when a driver that created a controller object is being unloaded or when the driver encounters a fatal error during device start-up, such as being unable to properly initialize a physical device.

A driver must release certain resources for which the driver supplied storage in its controller extension before it calls <b>IoDeleteController</b>. For example, if the driver stores the pointer to its interrupt object(s) in the controller extension, it must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iodisconnectinterrupt">IoDisconnectInterrupt</a> before <b>IoDeleteController</b>.
