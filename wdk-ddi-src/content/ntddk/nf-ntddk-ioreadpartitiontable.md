# IoReadPartitionTable function


## -description

The <b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> routine is <b>obsolete</b> and is provided only to support existing drivers. New drivers must use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-ioreadpartitiontableex">IoReadPartitionTableEx</a>. <b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> reads a list of partitions on a disk having a specified sector size and creates an entry in the partition list for each recognized partition.

## -parameters

### -param DeviceObject 

[in]
Pointer to the device object for the disk whose partitions are to be read.

### -param SectorSize 

[in]
Specifies the size of the sectors on the disk.

### -param ReturnRecognizedPartitions 

[in]
Indicates whether only recognized partitions or all partition entries should be returned.

### -param PartitionBuffer 

[out]
Pointer to an uninitialized address. If successful, <b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> allocates the memory for this buffer from nonpaged pool and returns the drive layout information in it.

## -returns

This routine returns a value of STATUS_SUCCESS if at least one sector table was read. Otherwise, it returns an error status and sets the pointer at <i>PartitionBuffer</i> to <b>NULL</b>.

## -remarks

<b>IoReadPartitionTable</b> must only be used by disk drivers. Other drivers should use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntdddisk/ni-ntdddisk-ioctl_disk_get_drive_layout">IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_LAYOUT</a> disk I/O request instead.

Disk device drivers call this routine during driver initialization.

It is the responsibility of the caller to deallocate the <i>PartitionBuffer</i> that was allocated by this routine with <b>ExFreePool</b>.

The algorithm used by this routine is determined by the Boolean value <i>ReturnRecognizedPartitions</i>:

<ul>
<li>
Read each partition table and, for each valid and recognized partition found, fill in an element in an array of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntdddisk/ns-ntdddisk-_partition_information">PARTITION_INFORMATION</a> entries. The array of partition information entries is pointed to by the <b>PartitionEntry</b> member of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntdddisk/ns-ntdddisk-_drive_layout_information">DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION</a> structure. The DRIVE_LAYOUT_INFORMATION structure is found at the location pointed to by <i>PartitionBuffer</i>. Extended partitions are located in order to find other partition tables, but no entries are built for them.

</li>
</ul>
Read each partition table and, for each and every entry, fill in a partition information entry. Extended partitions are located to find each partition on the disk; entries are built for these as well.
