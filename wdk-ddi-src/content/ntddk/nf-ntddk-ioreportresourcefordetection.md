# IoReportResourceForDetection function


## -description


The <b>IoReportResourceForDetection</b> routine claims hardware resources in the configuration registry for a legacy device.


## -parameters




### -param DriverObject [in]

Pointer to the driver object that was input to the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/driverentry-of-ide-controller-minidriver">DriverEntry</a> routine.


### -param DriverList [in, optional]

Optionally points to a caller-supplied buffer that contains the driver's resource list, if the driver claims the same resources for all its devices. If the caller specifies a <i>DeviceList</i>, this parameter is ignored.


### -param DriverListSize [in, optional]

Specifies the size in bytes of an optional <i>DriverList</i>. If <i>DriverList</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this parameter should be zero.


### -param DeviceObject [in, optional]

Optionally points to the device object representing device for which the driver is attempting to claim resources. 


### -param DeviceList [in, optional]

Optionally points to a caller-supplied buffer containing the device's resource list. If the driver claims the same resources for all its devices, the caller can specify a <i>DriverList</i> instead. 


### -param DeviceListSize [in, optional]

Specifies the size in bytes of an optional <i>DeviceList</i>. If <i>DeviceList</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this parameter should be zero. 


### -param ConflictDetected [out]

Pointer to a caller-supplied Boolean value that is set to <b>TRUE</b> on return if the resources are not available. 


## -returns



<b>IoReportResourceForDetection</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the resources are claimed. Possible error return values include the following.

## -remarks



This routine is for drivers that detect earlier hardware which cannot be enumerated by Plug and Play (PnP).

If a driver supports only PnP hardware, it does no detection and therefore does not call <b>IoReportResourceForDetection</b>. The PnP system enumerates each PnP device, assigns resources to the device, and passes those resources to the device's drivers in an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-start-device">IRP_MN_START_DEVICE</a> request.

If a PnP driver supports legacy hardware, however, it must call <b>IoReportResourceForDetection</b> to claim hardware resources before it attempts to detect the device.

Callers of this routine specify a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_cm_resource_list">CM_RESOURCE_LIST</a> in either a <i>DeviceList</i> or a <i>DriverList</i> that is allocated from paged memory and that consists of raw, untranslated resources. The caller is responsible for freeing the memory. 

A driver that can control more than one legacy card at the same time should claim the resources for each device against the device object for the respective device (using the <i>DeviceObject</i>, <i>DeviceList</i>, and <i>DeviceListSize</i> parameters). Such a driver must not claim these resources against their driver object.

A <b>CM_RESOURCE_LIST</b> contains two variable-sized arrays. Each array has a default size of one. If either array has more than one element, the caller must allocate memory dynamically to contain the additional elements. Only one <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_cm_partial_resource_descriptor">CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> can be part of each <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_cm_full_resource_descriptor">CM_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR</a> in the list, except for the last full resource descriptor in the <b>CM_RESOURCE_LIST</b>, which can have additional partial resource descriptors in its array.

<b>IoReportResourceForDetection</b>, with the help of the PnP manager, determines whether the resources being requested conflict with resources that have already been claimed.

If a conflict is detected, this routine sets the BOOLEAN at <i>ConflictDetected</i> to <b>TRUE</b> and returns STATUS_CONFLICTING_ADDRESSES. 

If no conflict is detected, this routine claims the resources, sets the BOOLEAN at <i>ConflictDetected</i> to <b>FALSE</b>, and returns STATUS_SUCCESS.

If this routine succeeds and the driver detects a legacy device, the driver reports the device to the PnP manager by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/nf-ntddk-ioreportdetecteddevice">IoReportDetectedDevice</a>. In that call, the driver sets <i>ResourceAssigned</i> to <b>TRUE</b> so the PnP manager does not attempt to claim the resources again.

When a driver no longer requires the resources claimed by a call to this routine, the driver calls this routine again with a <i>DriverList</i> or <i>DeviceList</i> with a <b>Count</b> of zero.

If a driver claims resources on a device-specific basis for more than one device, the driver must call this routine for each such device.

A driver can call this routine more than once for a given device. If one set of resources fails, the driver can call the routine again for the same device with a different set of resources. If a set of resources succeeds, the driver can call this routine again with a new list; the new list replaces the previous list.

Callers of <b>IoReportResourceForDetection</b> must be running at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL in the context of a system thread.
