### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.ReservedValid

Reserved for system use.


### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.TransactionType

The type of transaction that was in progress when the error occurred. Possible values are:



This member contains valid data only if the <b>TransactionTypeValid</b> bit is set.


### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Operation

The type of translation lookaside buffer (TLB) access operation that caused the error. Possible values are:



This member contains valid data only if the <b>OperationValid</b> bit is set.


### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Level

The level of the TLB where the error occurred.

This member contains valid data only if the <b>LevelValid</b> bit is set.


### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.ProcessorContextCorrupt

A single bit that indicates that the processor context might have been corrupted.

This member contains valid data only if the <b>ProcessorContextCorruptValid</b> bit is set.


### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Uncorrected

A single bit that indicates that the error has not been corrected.

This member contains valid data only if the <b>UncorrectedValid</b> bit is set.


### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.PreciseIP

## -remarks



If the <b>CheckInfoId</b> member of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/ns-ntddk-_whea_xpf_procinfo">WHEA_XPF_PROCINFO</a> structure contains WHEA_TLBCHECK_GUID, the <b>CheckInfo</b> member of the WHEA_XPF_PROCINFO structure contains a WHEA_XPF_TLB_CHECK union.
