# RtlRealSuccessor function


## -description


The <b>RtlRealSuccessor</b> routine returns a pointer to the successor of the specified node in the splay link tree. 


## -parameters




### -param Links [in]

Pointer to the node. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>. 


## -returns



<b>RtlRealSuccessor</b> returns a pointer to the successor of the node at <i>Links</i>, or <b>NULL</b> if the node has no successor. 




## -remarks



The real successor of a given node is determined as follows:

<ul>
<li>
If the given node has a right subtree, the leftmost node in the right subtree of the node at <i>Links</i> is the successor. Note that <b>RtlSubtreeSuccessor</b> returns the same result for this case. 

</li>
<li>
Otherwise, the nearest ancestor node, of which the given node is a left-subtree descendant, is the successor. 

</li>
</ul>
Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlRealSuccessor</b> must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the tree is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
