## -description

This routine adds a new section to an error report, and hands the caller a buffer set that can be populated with information.

## -parameters

### -param ErrorHandle

A WHEA_ERROR_HANDLE obtained from [**WheaCreateHwErrorReportDeviceDriver**](nf-ntddk-wheacreatehwerrorreportdevicedriver.md) that specifies the packet that is being operated on.

### -param SectionDataLength

A ULONG that specifies the length, in bytes, of the data to be added to the section.

### -param BufferSet

A pointer to a [**WHEA_DRIVER_BUFFER_SET**](ns-ntddk-whea_driver_buffer_set.md) structure that will be populated with a set of buffers for the user to interact with.

## -returns

Returns STATUS_SUCCESS or one of the following:

* STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE: The ErrorHandle is invalid.
* STATUS_DEVICE_REMOVED: The error source has been removed.
* STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES: There is not enough space for the data.

## -remarks

This routine can be called up to **MaxSectionsPerReport** times as specified in the [**WHEA_ERROR_SOURCE_CONFIGURATION_DEVICE_DRIVER**](ns-ntddk-whea_error_source_configuration_device_driver.md) structure supplied to [**WheaAddErrorSourceDeviceDriver**](nf-ntddk-wheaadderrorsourcedevicedriver.md).

Also see [**WheaHwErrorReportSetSectionNameDeviceDriver**](nf-ntddk-wheahwerrorreportsetsectionnamedevicedriver.md), which is a helper function for updating the FRUText.
