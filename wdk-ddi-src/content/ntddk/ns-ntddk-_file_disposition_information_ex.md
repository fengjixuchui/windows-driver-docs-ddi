# _FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION_EX structure


## -description


The <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_INFORMATION_EX</b> structure is used as an argument to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-zwsetinformationfile">ZwSetInformationFile</a> routine and indicates how the operating system should delete a file.


## -struct-fields




### -field Flags

Specifies what action(s) the system should take with a specific file while deleting.

## -remarks



The caller must have DELETE access to a given file to call ZwSetInformationFile with <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_DELETE</b>. 


When <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_POSIX_SEMANTICS</b> is not set, a file marked for deletion is not actually deleted until all open handles for the file have been closed and the link count for the file is zero.  When <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_POSIX_SEMANTICS</b> is set, the link is removed from the visible namespace as soon as the POSIX delete handle has been closed, but the file’s data streams remain accessible by other existing handles until the last handle has been closed. That is, applications that already had the file open can still use their handle to read/write even though the name they used to open it is gone and the file's link count may have reached zero.

If the file is being deleted at user request, using POSIX semantics allows the system to delete the file as requested, but also allows any process with an open handle to continue to access the file's data as long as the handle is open.

A return value of STATUS_CANNOT_DELETE indicates that either the file is read-only, or there's an existing mapped view to the file.  Specifying <b>FILE_DISPOSITION_IGNORE_READONLY_ATTRIBUTE</b> avoids this return value due to the file being read-only, provided the caller has FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES access to the file (the access that would be required to clear the read-only attribute).
