# IoPropagateActivityIdToThread function


## -description


The <b>IoPropagateActivityIdToThread</b> routine associates the activity ID from an IRP with the current thread.


## -parameters




### -param Irp [in]

The IRP whose ID will be propagated to the thread.


### -param PropagatedId [out]

A pointer to memory allocated by the caller to store the ID in the thread.


### -param OriginalId

<p>Upon successfully returning from the call, holds the ID that was previously set on the thread. The driver must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/nf-ntddk-ioclearactivityidthread"><b>IoClearActivityIdThread</b></a> with this pointer when tracing is completed within the same thread context.</p>




## -returns



<b>IoPropagateActivityIdToThread</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call is successful. Possible error return values include the following.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>STATUS_NOT_FOUND</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The IRP does not have an ID associated with it.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



This routine should be used by drivers that are tracing aware and are issuing I/O on a worker thread. Note that such drivers must call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/nf-ntddk-ioclearactivityidthread">IoClearActivityIdThread</a> with the <i>OriginalId</i> before they return control from the thread, if the call was successful.

Drivers that use I/O work items do not need to call this routine because the I/O subsystem takes care of propagating activity IDs to threads in that case.
