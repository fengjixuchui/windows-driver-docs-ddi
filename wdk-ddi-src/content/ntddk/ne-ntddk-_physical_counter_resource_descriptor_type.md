# _PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE enumeration


## -description


The <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE</b> enumeration contains constants that indicate the type of hardware performance counter resource that is described by a [PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md) structure.


## -enum-fields




### -field ResourceTypeSingle

A single hardware counter. The counter is described by the <b>u.CounterIndex</b> member of the [PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md) structure.


### -field ResourceTypeRange

A range of counter indexes. The counter indexes are described by the <b>u.Range</b> member of the [PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md) structure.


### -field ResourceTypeExtendedCounterConfiguration

An extended counter configuration register address. Specifying this value will result in [**HalAllocateHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md) returning **STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED**.


### -field ResourceTypeOverflow

A counter overflow interrupt handler. The interrupt handler to be invoked is described by the <b>u.OverflowHandler</b> member of the [PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md) structure.

### -field ResourceTypeEventBuffer

An event buffer configuration. The configuration of the event buffer threshold, entry size, and overflow handler are described by the <b>u.EventBufferConfiguration</b> member of the [PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md) structure.

### -field ResourceTypeMax

The maximum value in this enumeration type.


## -remarks



The <b>Type</b> member of a [**PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR**](ns-ntddk-_physical_counter_resource_descriptor.md) structure uses a <b>PHYSICAL_COUNTER_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE</b> enumeration constant to indicate the type of counter resource that is described by the structure.
