# IoGetInitiatorProcess function


## -description


The IoGetInitiatorProcess routine retrieves the process which initiated the creation of a file object if different than the process which is issuing the create.


## -parameters




### -param FileObject [in]

The file object from which to retrieve the initiator process.


## -returns



NULL if there is no initiator process. Otherwise, a pointer to which process initiated the creation of the file object.




## -remarks



A driver normally uses IoGetInitiatorProcess to determine which process has issued a request.  However, there are situations where a system component may issue a create on behalf of another process (after a successful create the component will duplicate the handle to the process).  This routine can be used if the driver must know which process the create operation is ultimately intended for.
