# RtlSplay function


## -description


The <b>RtlSplay</b> routine rebalances, or "splays," a splay link tree around the specified splay link, making that link the new root of the tree.


## -parameters




### -param Links [in, out]

A pointer to the node that is to become the root node of the rebalanced splay link tree. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>. 


## -returns



<b>RtlSplay</b> returns the <i>Links</i> pointer when it has rebalanced the tree. 




## -remarks



If L is the given link, P is its parent node, and G is its grandparent node, <b>RtlSplay</b> rebalances a splay link tree according to one of the six patterns shown in the following figure.

Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlSplay</b> must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the tree is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
