# IOCTL_INTERNAL_MOUSE_CONNECT IOCTL


## -description

The IOCTL_INTERNAL_MOUSE_CONNECT request connects Mouclass service to a mouse device. Mouclass sends this request down the device stack before it opens a mouse device. 

After Moufiltr receives the mouse connect request, it filters the request in the following way:
<ol>
<li>
Saves a copy of the <a href="/previous-versions/ff538375(v=vs.85)">CONNECT_DATA (Mouclass)</a> structure that was passed to Moufiltr

</li>
<li>
Substitutes its own connect information for the class driver connect information

</li>
<li>
Sends the IOCTL_INTERNAL_MOUSE_CONNECT request down the device stack

</li>
</ol>If the request is not successful, Moufiltr completes the request with an appropriate error status.

Moufiltr provides a template for a filter service callback routine that can supplement the operation of <a href="/previous-versions/ff542394(v=vs.85)">MouseClassServiceCallback</a>, the Mouclass service callback routine. The filter service callback can filter the input data that is transferred from the device input buffer to the class driver data queue.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.Type3InputBuffer</b> member points to a CONNECT_DATA structure that is allocated and set by Mouclass.

### -input-buffer-length

The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> member is set to a value greater than or equal to the size, in bytes, of a CONNECT_DATA structure.

### -output-buffer

The <b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.Type3InputBuffer</b> member points to a CONNECT_DATA structure that is set by Moufiltr.

### -output-buffer-length

The size of a CONNECT_DATA structure.

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

The <b>Information</b> member is set to zero.

The <b>Status</b> member is set to one of the following values:




**STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER**

<b>Parameters.DeviceIoControl.InputBufferLength</b> is less than the size, in bytes, of a CONNECT_DATA structure.


**STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION**

Moufiltr is already connected (a filter driver supports only one connect request).
