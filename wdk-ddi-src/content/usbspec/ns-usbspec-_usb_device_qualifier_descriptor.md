# _USB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>USB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve a USB-defined device qualifier descriptor.


## -struct-fields




### -field bLength

Specifies the length, in bytes, of this descriptor.


### -field bDescriptorType

Specifies the descriptor type. Must be set to <b>USB_DEVICE_QUALIFIER_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE</b>.


### -field bcdUSB

Identifies the version of the USB specification that this descriptor structure complies with. This value is a binary-coded decimal number.


### -field bDeviceClass

Specifies the class code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bDeviceSubClass

Specifies the subclass code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bDeviceProtocol

Specifies the protocol code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bMaxPacketSize0

Specifies the maximum packet size, in bytes, for endpoint zero of the device. The value must be set to 8, 16, 32, or 64.


### -field bNumConfigurations

Specifies the total number of possible configurations for the device.


### -field bReserved

Reserved.


## -remarks



This structure is similar to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/usbspec/ns-usbspec-_usb_device_descriptor">USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</a>, but it contains only those members that can change when the device switches from full-speed operation to high-speed operation or vice versa. If the device is operating at full speed, querying for this descriptor will contain information about how the device would operate at high-speed. If, on the other hand, the device is operating at high-speed, this descriptor will contain information about how the device would operate at full-speed.
