# _USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The <b>USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve a USB-defined device descriptor.
The members of this structure are described in the Universal Serial Bus 3.1 Specification available at [USB Document Library](https://www.usb.org/documents). See section 9.6.1.

## -struct-fields




### -field bLength

Specifies the length, in bytes, of this descriptor.


### -field bDescriptorType

Specifies the descriptor type. Must be set to <b>USB_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE</b>.


### -field bcdUSB

Identifies the version of the USB specification that this descriptor structure complies with. This value is a binary-coded decimal number.


### -field bDeviceClass

Specifies the class code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bDeviceSubClass

Specifies the subclass code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bDeviceProtocol

Specifies the protocol code of the device as assigned by the USB specification group.


### -field bMaxPacketSize0

Specifies the maximum packet size, in bytes, for endpoint zero of the device. The value must be set to 8, 16, 32, or 64.


### -field idVendor

Specifies the vendor identifier for the device as assigned by the USB specification committee.


### -field idProduct

Specifies the product identifier. This value is assigned by the manufacturer and is device-specific.


### -field bcdDevice

Identifies the version of the device. This value is a binary-coded decimal number.


### -field iManufacturer

Specifies a device-defined index of the string descriptor that provides a string containing the name of the manufacturer of this device.


### -field iProduct

Specifies a device-defined index of the string descriptor that provides a string that contains a description of the device.


### -field iSerialNumber

Specifies a device-defined index of the string descriptor that provides a string that contains a manufacturer-determined serial number for the device.


### -field bNumConfigurations

Specifies the total number of possible configurations for the device.


## -remarks



This structure is used to hold a retrieved USB-defined device descriptor. This information can then be used to further configure or retrieve information about the device. Device descriptors are retrieved by submitting a get-descriptor URB.

The <b>iManufacturer</b>, <b>iProduct</b>, and <b>iSerialNumber</b> values, when returned from the host controller driver, contain index values into an array of string descriptors maintained by the device. To retrieve these strings, a string descriptor request can be sent to the device using these index values.
