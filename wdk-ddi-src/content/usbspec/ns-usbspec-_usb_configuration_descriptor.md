# _USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR structure


## -description


The  <b>USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR</b> structure is used by USB client drivers to hold a USB-defined configuration descriptor.
The members of this structure are described in the Universal Serial Bus 3.1 Specification available at [USB Document Library](https://www.usb.org/documents). See section 9.6.3.

## -struct-fields




### -field bLength

Specifies the length, in bytes, of this structure.


### -field bDescriptorType

Specifies the descriptor type. Must be set to USB_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE.


### -field wTotalLength

Specifies the total length, in bytes, of all data for the configuration. The length includes all interface, endpoint, class, or vendor-specific descriptors that are returned with the configuration descriptor.


### -field bNumInterfaces

Specifies the total number of interfaces supported by this configuration.


### -field bConfigurationValue

Contains the value that is used to select a configuration. This value is passed to the USB SetConfiguration request , as described in version 1.1 of the Universal Serial Bus Specification. The port driver does not currently expose a service that allows higher-level drivers to set the configuration. 


### -field iConfiguration

Specifies the device-defined index of the string descriptor for this configuration.


### -field bmAttributes

Specifies a bitmap to describe behavior of this configuration. The bits are described and set in little-endian order.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
7

</td>
<td>
The configuration is powered by the bus.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field MaxPower

Specifies the power requirements of this device in two-milliampere units. This member is valid only if bit seven is set in <b>bmAttributes</b>.


## -remarks



If <b>wTotalLength</b> is greater than the buffer size provided in the URB to hold all descriptors retrieved (interface, endpoint, class, and vendor-defined), incomplete data will be returned. In order to retrieve complete descriptors, the request will need to be re-sent with a larger buffer.

If <b>bmAttributes</b> bits six and seven are both set, then the device is powered both by the bus and by a source external to the bus.

Other members that are part of this structure but not described here should be treated as opaque and considered to be reserved for system use.
