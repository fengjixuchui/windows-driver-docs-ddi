# _WDF_CALLBACK_CONSTRAINT enumeration


## -description




## -enum-fields




### -field None

No callback functions into the driver are synchronized.  The driver must handle all synchronization.


### -field WdfDeviceLevel

All callback functions into the driver that are associated with the device are synchronized, including all callback functions that are associated with I/O queues. Only one event handler that is associated with the device can run at any given time.


### -field WdfLevelReserved

Reserved.


### -field WdfLevelMaximum




## -remarks



Note that the above locking models apply only for I/O (that is, open, read, write, and device I/O control) operations and not for Plug and Play (PnP) and power management notifications.
