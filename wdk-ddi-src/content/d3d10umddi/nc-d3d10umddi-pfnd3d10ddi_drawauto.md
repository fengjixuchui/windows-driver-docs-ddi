# PFND3D10DDI_DRAWAUTO callback function


## -description


The <b>DrawAuto</b> function works similarly to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_draw">Draw</a> function, except <b>DrawAuto</b> is used for the special case where vertex data is written through the stream-output unit and then recycled as a vertex buffer. The driver determines the number of primitives, in part, by how much data was written to the buffer through stream output. 


## -parameters




### -param Arg1


*hDevice* [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).




## -remarks

The driver can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. 



The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>DrawAuto</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
