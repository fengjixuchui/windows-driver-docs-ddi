# PFND3DWDDM1_3DDI_SETMARKERMODE callback function


## -description


Notifies the user-mode display driver that it should support a type of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) marker event. Must be implemented by Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) 1.3 and later drivers.


## -parameters




### -param hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param Type [in]

A value from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3d10umddi/ne-d3d10umddi-d3dwddm1_3ddi_marker_type">D3DWDDM1_3DDI_MARKER_TYPE</a> enumeration that indicates the type of marker event  that the driver should support.


### -param Flags

A <b>UINT</b> value that indicates whether the driver should provide custom info in command buffers. If set to <b>D3DWDDM1_3DDI_SETMARKERMODE_CUSTOMDRIVEREVENTS</b>, the driver should annotate and instrument command buffers with custom event info. Otherwise, the driver should not annotate command buffers.

The annotation can be in the form of a text string in the English-US locale, or in the form of an index value to a location in a string table. For the latter option, the driver must also implement a function that describes the strings that the index values indicate.


## -returns




      Returns <b>S_OK</b> or an appropriate error result if the function does not complete successfully.




## -remarks



Follow these guidelines when you set up profile-type marker events in your user-mode driver, indicated by the <b>D3DWDDM1_3DDI_MARKER_TYPE_PROFILE</b> type:

<ol>
<li>Use lightweight instrumentation that doesn't produce a strong correlation with graphics command boundaries.</li>
<li>The driver must be able to sample the GPU time stamp at the end of the graphics pipeline.</li>
<li>Don't use sampling commands that place a high performance burden on the graphics pipeline, such as wait-for-idle commands. To be able to instrument profile-type marker events, your driver shouldn't have to flush the pipeline or caches.</li>
</ol>
