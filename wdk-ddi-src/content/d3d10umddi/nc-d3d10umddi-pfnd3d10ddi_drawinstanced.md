# PFND3D10DDI_DRAWINSTANCED callback function


## -description


The <b>DrawInstanced</b> function draws particular instances of nonindexed primitives.


## -parameters




### -param Arg1

*hDevice* [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### -param Arg2

*VertexCountPerInstance* [in]

The number of vertices per instance of the buffer that vertices are read from to draw the primitives.

### -param Arg3

*InstanceCount* [in]

The number of instances of the buffer that vertices are read from to draw the primitives.

### -param Arg4

*StartVertexLocation* [in]

The first vertex in the buffer that vertices are read from to draw the primitives.

### -param Arg5

*StartInstanceLocation* [in]

The first instance of the buffer that vertices are read from to draw the primitives. 



## -returns



None

The driver can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.




## -remarks



The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>DrawInstanced</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
