# PFND3D11_1DDI_VIDEOPROCESSORSETSTREAMEXTENSION callback function


## -description


Sets the private state data for a video processor stream from an application.


## -parameters




### -param Arg1

*hDevice* [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### -param Arg2

*hVideoProcessor* [in]

A handle to the video processor object that was created through a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d11_1ddi_createvideoprocessor">CreateVideoProcessor</a> function.

### -param Arg3

*StreamIndex* [in]

The zero-based index of the input stream.

### -param Arg4

*pGuid* [in]

A pointer to a GUID that identifies the private state data. The meaning of this GUID is defined by the graphics driver.

### -param Arg5

*DataSize* [in]

The size, in bytes, of the private state data in the buffer referenced by the <i>pData</i> parameter.



### -param Arg6

*pData* [in, out]

A pointer to a buffer that contains the private state data. 



> [!NOTE]
> The Direct3D runtime does not validate the private state data in the buffer before it calls the  <b>VideoProcessorSetStreamExtension</b> function</div>
<div> </div>



## -returns



<b>VideoProcessorSetStreamExtension</b> returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|S_OK|The private state data was set successfully.|
|D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED|The graphics adapter was removed.|
|E_FAIL|The display miniport driver cannot set the requested private state data for the video processor.|
|E_INVALIDARG|Parameters were validated and determined to be incorrect.|
