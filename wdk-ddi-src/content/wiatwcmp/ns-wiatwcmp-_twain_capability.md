# _TWAIN_CAPABILITY structure


## -description


The TWAIN_CAPABILITY structure holds information used when a TWAIN-compatible application communicates with a WIA driver.


## -struct-fields




### -field lSize

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the TWAIN_CAPABILITY structure.


### -field lMSG

Specifies the particular TWAIN message, which can be one of the following values: 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MSG_GET

</td>
<td>
Get a capability.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MSG_GETCURRENT

</td>
<td>
Get the current capability.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MSG_GETDEFAULT

</td>
<td>
Get the default capability.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MSG_RESET

</td>
<td>
Reset the capability.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
MSG_SET

</td>
<td>
Set a capability.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field lCapID

Specifies the ID of the capability to set or get.


### -field lConType

Specifies the capability's container type.


### -field lRC

Specifies the TWAIN return code. This value can be on of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TWRC_FAILURE

</td>
<td>
The capability specified by the <b>lCapID</b> member is not supported.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TWRC_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
The capability specified by the <b>lCapID</b> member is supported.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Other TWRC_XXX return code

</td>
<td>
See the <b>Remarks</b> section.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field lCC

Specifies the TWAIN condition code. This value can be one of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TWCC_BUMMER

</td>
<td>
The operation failed for an unknown reason.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TWCC_SUCCESS

</td>
<td>
The operation was successful.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
TWCC_XXX

</td>
<td>
See the <b>Remarks</b> section.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -field lDataSize

Specifies the size, in bytes of the data in the <b>Data</b> array.


### -field Data

Is an array that contains the capability data. The actual size, in bytes, of the array is indicated by the <b>lDataSize</b> member.


## -remarks



A TWAIN-capable application communicates with a WIA driver by way of the TWAIN compatibility later to find out whether the driver has any private capabilities, and if so, what they are. A TWAIN_CAPABILITY structure is used in this communication. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/image/twain-compatibility">TWAIN Compatibility</a>. 

The TWAIN return codes and control codes are defined in <i>twain.h</i>, which can be obtained from the TWAIN Working Group (http://www.twain.org).
