The **NetPacketIteratorSet** method completes a client driver's post or drain operation on the packet ring.

## -parameters

### -param Iterator

A pointer to a [**NET_RING_PACKET_ITERATOR**](../netringiterator/ns-netringiterator-_net_ring_packet_iterator.md) structure.

## -returns

None.

## -remarks

**NetPacketIteratorSet** sets the packet iterator's **IndexToSet** to its **Index**, which indicates to the OS that the client driver has finished processing the packets from **IndexToSet** to **Index - 1** inclusive. Client drivers call this method to finish posting packets to hardware, or to finish draining packets to the OS.

For an animation and code example of draining packets back to the OS, see [Net rings and net ring iterators](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/net-rings-and-net-ring-iterators).
