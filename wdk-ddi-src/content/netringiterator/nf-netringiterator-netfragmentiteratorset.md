The **NetFragmentIteratorSet** method completes a client driver's post or drain operation on the fragment ring.

## -parameters

### -param Iterator

A pointer to a [**NET_RING_FRAGMENT_ITERATOR**](../netringiterator/ns-netringiterator-_net_ring_fragment_iterator.md) structure.

## -returns

None.

## -remarks

**NetFragmentIteratorSet** sets the fragment iterator's **IndexToSet** to its **Index**, which indicates to the OS that the client driver has finished processing the fragments from **IndexToSet** to **Index - 1** inclusive. Client drivers call this method to finish posting fragments to hardware, or to finish draining fragments to the OS.

For an animation and code example of draining fragments back to the OS, see [Net rings and net ring iterators](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/net-rings-and-net-ring-iterators).
