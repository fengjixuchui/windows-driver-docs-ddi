The **NetRingGetAllFragments** method gets a fragment iterator for the entire range that a client driver owns in a fragment ring.

## -parameters

### -param Rings

A pointer to the [**NET_RING_COLLECTION**](../ringcollection/ns-ringcollection-_net_ring_collection.md) struture that describes the packet queue's net rings.

## -returns

Returns a [**NET_RING_FRAGMENT_ITERATOR**](../netringiterator/ns-netringiterator-_net_ring_fragment_iterator.md) that begins at the fragment ring's **BeginIndex** and ends at the fragment ring's **EndIndex**. In other words, the iterator covers both the ring's post subsection and its drain subsection, or all fragments in the ring that the driver currently owns.

## -remarks

Client drivers typically call **NetRingGetAllFragments** to begin performing operations on all fragments that they own in a fragment ring. This might include processing a batch of receives that span all available fragments in the ring, or draining the ring during data path cancellation.

For a code example of using this method, see [Net rings and net ring iterators](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/net-rings-and-net-ring-iterators).
