# DXGKCB_UNMAPMDLFROMIOMMU callback function


## -description

Implemented by the client driver to release the mapping that was set by [DXGKCB_MAPMDLTOIOMMU](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_mapmdltoiommu.md).

## -parameters

### -param hAdapter

A handle to a display adapter. The driver provides this handle for the master/lead device in the LDA chain.

### -param pUnmapMdlFromIoMmu

A pointer to the [DXGKARGCB_UNMAPMDLFROMIOMMU](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkargcb_unmapmdlfromiommu.md) structure that contains a handle to the memory to be unmapped.

## -prototype

```cpp
//Declaration

DXGKCB_UNMAPMDLFROMIOMMU DxgkcbUnmapmdlfromiommu;

// Definition

VOID DxgkcbUnmapmdlfromiommu
(
	IN_CONST_HANDLE hAdapter
	IN_CONST_PDXGKARGCB_UNMAPMDLFROMIOMMU pUnmapMdlFromIoMmu
)
{...}

DXGKCB_UNMAPMDLFROMIOMMU


```

## -remarks

Register your implementation of this callback function by setting the appropriate member of DXGKARGCB_UNMAPMDLFROMIOMMU and then calling DxgkCbUnmapMdlFromIoMmu.
