# DXGKCB_GETHANDLEPARENT callback function


## -description

The <b>DxgkCbGetHandleParent</b> function retrieves the parent resource from the specified allocation.

## -parameters

### -param hAllocation

[in] A handle to an allocation. This handle must be the kernel-mode handle that the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>) assigned for the allocation.

## -returns

<b>DxgkCbGetHandleParent</b> returns a graphics subsystem-specific handle to the parent resource for the allocation that is associated with the handle that the <i>hAllocation</i> parameter specifies.

If <i>DxgkCbGetHandleParent</i> returns a <b>NULL</b> handle, the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem was unable to resolve the handle to the parent resource because, for example, of the following possible reasons:



<ul>
<li>An invalid handle was received from the user-mode display driver because of a malicious attack or some other bug.</li>
<li>Allocations had lifetime issues. </li>
</ul>
If a <b>NULL</b> handle is returned, the display miniport driver should fail its currently running DDI function with STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE.

## -remarks

For <b>DxgkCbGetHandleParent</b> to return a resource handle, the handle in <i>hAllocation</i> must be an allocation handle that is associated with a resource; otherwise, <b>DxgkCbGetHandleParent</b> returns <b>NULL</b>.
