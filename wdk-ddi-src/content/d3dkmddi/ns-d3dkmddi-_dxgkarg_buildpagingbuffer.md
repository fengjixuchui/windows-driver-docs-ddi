# _DXGKARG_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER structure


## -description


The <b>DXGKARG_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER</b> structure describes parameters for building a paging buffer that is used in a memory-transfer operation.


## -struct-fields




### -field pDmaBuffer

[in/out] A virtual address to the first available byte in the paging buffer. When the driver is first called with a new paging buffer, this virtual address is aligned on 4 KB. The driver tightly packs operations in the paging buffer until the paging buffer is full and then uses a new paging buffer. Therefore, if the graphics processing unit (GPU) requires a specific alignment for a paging-buffer submission, the driver should enforce this alignment by padding the operations that it writes to the paging buffer. Before the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer">DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer</a> function returns, the driver should update <b>pDmaBuffer</b> to point past the last byte that is written to the paging buffer. 


### -field DmaSize

[in/out] The size, in bytes, of the paging buffer that <b>pDmaBuffer</b> specifies.


### -field pDmaBufferPrivateData

[in/out] A pointer to a driver-resident private data structure that is associated with the direct memory access (DMA) buffer (that is, paging buffer) that <b>pDmaBuffer</b> specifies.


### -field DmaBufferPrivateDataSize

[in/out] The number of bytes that remain in the private data structure that <b>pDmaBufferPrivateData</b> points to for the current operation.


### -field Operation

[in] A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ne-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_buildpagingbuffer_operation">DXGK_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER_OPERATION</a>-typed value that indicates the type of memory operation to perform. 


### -field MultipassOffset

[in/out] A UINT value that specifies the progress of the paging operation if multiple paging buffers are required. The driver sets this value to indicate a split into multiple paging buffers for more than one transfer operation. For example, the driver can store the page number that was last transferred for a paged-based transfer. 


### -field Transfer

[in] A structure that describes the transfer operation.


### -field Transfer.hAllocation

The allocation handle points to a buffer that contains private driver data for the transfer.


### -field Transfer.TransferOffset

This offset does not apply to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl">MDL</a> description of a memory range. If the driver requires more than one paging buffer to complete the transfer (that is, the driver returns STATUS_GRAPHICS_INSUFFICIENT_DMA_BUFFER from its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer">DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer</a> function), <b>TransferOffset</b> is the same for each call to <i>DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer</i> for this transfer.

### -field Transfer.Destination

[in] A structure that describes the destination allocation. This structure contains a <b>SegmentId</b> member and a union that contains either an offset into a segment of the destination allocation (<b>SegmentAddress</b>) or a pointer to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl">MDL</a> for the destination (<b>pMdl</b>).
