# _D3DKMT_PRESENT_DISPLAY_ONLY_FLAGS structure


## -description


Indicates how a kernel mode display-only driver (KMDOD) is to perform a present operation.


## -struct-fields




### -field Rotate

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether to rotate the presentation data to match the current orientation of the screen during the presentation bit-block transfer (bitblt). The current orientation of the screen is set in the <b>Rotation</b> member of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_d3dkmdt_vidpn_present_path_transformation">D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH_TRANSFORMATION</a> structure, which is set in the <b>ContentTransformation</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_d3dkmdt_vidpn_present_path">D3DKMDT_VIDPN_PRESENT_PATH</a> structure for the video present path.

The KMDOD should rotate the data only if the <b>Rotate</b> bit-field flag is set. Even if the KMDOD determines that the current orientation of the screen is rotated from the presentation data and <b>Rotate</b> is not set, the KMDOD should not rotate the data.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field Reserved

[in] This member is reserved and should be set to zero.

Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFF) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that <b>D3DKMT_PRESENT_DISPLAY_ONLY_FLAGS</b> contains that can hold a 32-bit value that identifies the type of present operation to perform.
