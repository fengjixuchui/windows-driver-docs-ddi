# _DXGK_SETPOINTERPOSITIONFLAGS structure


## -description


The <b>DXGK_SETPOINTERPOSITIONFLAGS</b> structure identifies, in bit-field flags, information about a mouse pointer.


## -struct-fields




### -field Visible

[in] A <b>UINT</b> value that specifies whether the mouse pointer is visible. If this member is set, the mouse pointer is visible; if this member is not set, the mouse pointer is invisible. The driver should ignore the values in the <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> members of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setpointerposition">DXGKARG_SETPOINTERPOSITION</a> structure if <b>Visible</b> is not set (that is, <b>Visible</b> is set to 0). 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field Procedural

[in] A <b>UINT</b> value that specifies whether the mouse pointer position was set by an application with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/b17cf57f-dd96-4695-a51e-ee1e1f00f85f">SetCursorPos</a> or similar cursor function instead of coming from user device input.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).

Supported starting with Windows 8.


### -field Reserved

[in] This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting remaining 30 bits (0xFFFFFFFC) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

[in] A member in the union that <b>DXGK_SETPOINTERPOSITIONFLAGS</b> contains that can hold one 32-bit value that indicates information about a mouse pointer.
