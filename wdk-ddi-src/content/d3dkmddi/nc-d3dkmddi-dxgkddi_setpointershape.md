# DXGKDDI_SETPOINTERSHAPE callback function


## -description


The <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> function sets the appearance and location of the mouse pointer.


## -parameters




### -param hAdapter [in]

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.


### -param pSetPointerShape [in]

[in] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setpointershape">DXGKARG_SETPOINTERSHAPE</a> structure that describes the appearance and location of the mouse pointer.


## -returns



<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|STATUS_SUCCESS|The mouse pointer is successfully drawn.|
|STATUS_NO_MEMORY|DxgkDdiSetPointerShape could not allocate memory that was required for it to complete.|


## -remarks



The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> function to set information about the mouse pointer. The <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> function is called independently of all of the other display miniport driver functions. Therefore, a <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> thread can run simultaneously with another display miniport driver thread. However, the system ensures that <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_setpointerposition">DxgkDdiSetPointerPosition</a> threads cannot run simultaneously. 

If you run a <i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> thread simultaneously with another display miniport driver thread, the display miniport driver should be able to program the mouse pointer hardware independently of other activities, such as operations that send a command buffer through direct memory access (DMA) to the graphics hardware, operations that program the graphics hardware by using memory-mapped I/O (MMIO), and so on.

<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> is not called if the video present network (VidPN) topology that is associated with the <b>VidPnSourceId</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_setpointershape">DXGKARG_SETPOINTERSHAPE</a> structure that the <i>pSetPointerShape</i> parameter points to is disabled.

<i>DxgkDdiSetPointerShape</i> should be made pageable.
