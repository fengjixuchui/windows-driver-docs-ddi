# _DXGK_DESTROYALLOCATIONFLAGS structure


## -description

The DXGK_DESTROYALLOCATIONFLAGS structure identifies how to release allocations.

## -struct-fields

### -field DestroyResource

A UINT value that specifies whether the resource that the <b>hResource</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_destroyallocation">DXGKARG_DESTROYALLOCATION</a> structure specifies should be released along with allocations. 

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.

### -field Value

A member in the union that DXGK_DESTROYALLOCATIONFLAGS contains that can hold a 32-bit value that identifies how to release allocations.
