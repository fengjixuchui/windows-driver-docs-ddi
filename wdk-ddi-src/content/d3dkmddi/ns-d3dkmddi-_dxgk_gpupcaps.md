## -description

The GPU capabilities for a kernel mode display driver.

These caps must be filled out by the KMD in response to **DXGKQAITYPE_GPUPCAPS** [QueryAdapterInfo](ne-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_queryadapterinfotype.md) request. These are queried by the OS during device initialization after [DxgkDdiStartDevice](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device.md) is called and only if the adapter supports GPU partitioning.

## -struct-fields

### -field Caps

### -field Caps.VirtualMachineHibernation

The driver sets the cap if guest hibernation is supported for GPU-P devices.

### -field Caps.HotDriverUpdate

The driver sets the cap if hot driver update is supported for GPU-P devices.

### -field Caps.Reserved

Reserved.

### -field Caps.Value

The driver sets the cap if VM save/restore is supported for GPU-P devices.

The support for guest hibernation is optional and not required for driver certification.

A VM, which has hibernation enabled and a GPU-P adapter added, will fail to start, if the driver does not support guest hibernation.
