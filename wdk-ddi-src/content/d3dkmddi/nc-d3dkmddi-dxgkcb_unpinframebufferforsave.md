# DXGKCB_UNPINFRAMEBUFFERFORSAVE callback function

## -description

Implemented by the client driver to release the mapping that was set by [DXGKCB_PINFRAMEBUFFERFORSAVE](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_pinframebufferforsave.md).

## -prototype

```cpp
//Declaration

DXGKCB_UNPINFRAMEBUFFERFORSAVE DxgkcbUnpinframebufferforsave;

// Definition

NTSTATUS DxgkcbUnpinframebufferforsave
(
	IN_CONST_HANDLE hAdapter
	IN_CONST_PDXGKARGCB_UNPINFRAMEBUFFERFORSAVE pUnpinFrameBufferForSave
)
{...}

DXGKCB_UNPINFRAMEBUFFERFORSAVE


```

## -parameters

### -param hAdapter

A handle to a display adapter. The driver provides this handle for the master/lead device in the LDA chain.

### -param pUnpinFrameBufferForSave:

A pointer to the [DXGKARGCB_UNPINFRAMEBUFFERFORSAVE](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkargcb_unpinframebufferforsave.md) structure that contains a handle to the memory to be unmapped.

## -returns

Return STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, return an appropriate NTSTATUS Values error code.

## -remarks

Register your implementation of this callback function by setting the appropriate member of DXGKARGCB_UNPINFRAMEBUFFERFORSAVE and then calling DxgkCbUnpinFrameBufferForSave.
