# _DXGKARG_CONTROLMODEBEHAVIOR structure

## -description

Arguments used to describe display mode behaviors that the OS requests of the driver and the results of the request.

## -struct-fields

### -field Request

Indicates the behaviors that the OS is requesting

### -field Satisfied

Flags that report which requests were satisfied.  Only flags which were set in the Request field and which the driver has been able to apply the requested behavior should be set.

### -field NotSatisfied

Flags that report which requests were not satisfied.  Only flags which were set in the Request field which the driver supports on this adapter but could not be applied should be set.

## -remarks

If a behavior is not supported, then even if the driver comprehends the behavior, it should leave the flag bit clear in both the Satisfied and the NotSatisfied field.
