# _DXGK_ALLOCATIONUSAGEINFO1 structure


## -description

The DXGK_ALLOCATIONUSAGEINFO1 structure describes how an allocation can be used in DMA buffering.

## -struct-fields

### -field Flags

[out] A union that contains either a structure (with the first eight members that are described below) or a 32-bit value (in the <b>Value</b> member) that identifies how the allocation is used:

### -field Flags.PrivateFormat

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is a private vendor format.  

Setting this is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).

### -field Flags.Swizzled

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is swizzled or tiled. 

Setting this is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).

### -field Flags.MipMap

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is a MIP-mapped texture.

Setting this is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004).

### -field Flags.Cube

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is a cube texture. 

Setting this is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008).

### -field Flags.Volume

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is a volume texture.

Setting this is equivalent to setting the fifth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000010).

### -field Flags.Vertex

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is a vertex buffer.

Setting this is equivalent to setting the sixth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000020).

### -field Flags.Index

A UINT value that specifies whether the allocation is an index buffer.

Setting this is equivalent to setting the seventh bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000040).

### -field Flags.Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 25 bits (0xFFFFFF80) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.

### -field Flags.Value

Specifies a member in the union contained in the <b>Flags</b> member that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies how the allocation is used.

### -field Format

[out] A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dukmdt/ne-d3dukmdt-_d3dddiformat">D3DDDIFORMAT</a>-typed value that indicates the pixel format of the allocation. The <b>PrivateFormat</b> bit-field flag in the <b>Flags</b> member must be set to 0 (FALSE).

### -field PrivateFormat

[out] A private format value for the allocation. The <b>PrivateFormat</b> bit-field flag in the <b>Flags</b> member must be set to 1 (TRUE).

### -field SwizzledFormat

[out] A swizzled format value for the allocation that is private to a specific vendor.

### -field ByteOffset

[out] The offset, in bytes, into the video memory manager's allocation that marks the start of the driver's version of the allocation.

### -field Width

[out] The width, in pixels, of the allocation.

### -field Height

[out] The height, in number of lines, of the allocation.

### -field Pitch

[out] The pitch, in bytes, of the allocation--that is, the distance, in bytes, to the start of the next line.

### -field Depth

[out] The depth, in levels, of the allocation (for MIP-mapped and volume textures only).

### -field SlicePitch

[out] The slice pitch, in bytes, from level to level (for cube and volume textures only).
