# _DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION structure


## -description

The DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION structure describes how the display miniport driver should create allocations.

## -struct-fields

### -field pPrivateDriverData

[in] A pointer to a block of private data that is passed from the user-mode display driver to the display miniport driver. This member is typically used to provide data for a group of allocations. Note that this member is distinct from the <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> members of the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structures in the array that <b>pAllocationInfo</b> specifies. You can set private data for this member in addition to private data for each allocation.

### -field PrivateDriverDataSize

[in] The size, in bytes, of the private data that <b>pPrivateDriverData</b> points to.

### -field NumAllocations

[in] The number of elements in the array that <b>pAllocationInfo</b> specifies, which represents the number of allocations to create.

### -field pAllocationInfo

[in/out] An array of <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structures that describe the allocations to create.

### -field hResource

[in/out] A handle to a resource. The display miniport driver can set this handle to a value that the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem can subsequently pass in driver calls and that refers to information for the allocations. If the resource was already created by a previous <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> call, this member contains the handle that the driver previously returned.

### -field Flags

[in] A <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_createallocationflags">DXGK_CREATEALLOCATIONFLAGS</a> structure that identifies how to create allocations. Setting all of the bit-field flags to 0 indicates that allocations belong to the device and not to a particular resource.
