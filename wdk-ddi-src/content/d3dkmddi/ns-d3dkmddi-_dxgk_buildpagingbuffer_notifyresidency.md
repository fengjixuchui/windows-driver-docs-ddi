# _DXGK_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER_NOTIFYRESIDENCY structure


## -description


<b> DXGK_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER_NOTIFYRESIDENCY</b> describes a residency allocation change operation.


## -struct-fields




### -field hAllocation

The kernel mode driver handle returned from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a>.


### -field PhysicalAddress

The physical address of the allocation. The physical address (0, 0) is invalid and is used when the allocation is being evicted.  


### -field Resident

Set to 0 when the allocation is evicted and set to 1 when the allocation is committed.


### -field Reserved

This member is not used and should be set to zero.


## -remarks



The paging operations is issued only for allocations, for which the kernel mode driver sets the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfoflags">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFOFLAGS</a>::<b>ExplicitResidencyNotification</b> and <b>AccessedPhysically</b> flags.

The operation is issued after <i>FillVirtual</i> or <i>TransferVirtual</i> operations when the allocation is committed to a memory segment (<b>Resident</b> == 1). Note that the previous paging operations might not yet be finished by graphics processing unit (GPU).

The operation is issued before <i>TransferVirtual</i> operation when the allocation is evicted (<b>Resident</b> == 0) from a memory segment.


Note that the <i>NotifyResidency</i> operation will be issued only once during allocation eviction/commitment, while there might be several <i>TransferVirtual</i>/<i>FillVirtual</i> operations for a single allocation.
