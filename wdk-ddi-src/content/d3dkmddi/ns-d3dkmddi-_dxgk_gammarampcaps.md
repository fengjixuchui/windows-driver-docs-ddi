# _DXGK_GAMMARAMPCAPS structure


## -description


The DXGK_GAMMARAMPCAPS structure identifies gamma-ramp capabilities of the display miniport driver that the driver provides through a call to its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field Gamma_Rgb256x3x16

A UINT value that specifies whether gamma ramp data is stored as 256 16-bit RGB values. Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting the remaining 31 bits (0xFFFFFFFE) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that DXGK_GAMMARAMPCAPS contains that can hold a 32-bit value that identifies gamma-ramp capabilities.
