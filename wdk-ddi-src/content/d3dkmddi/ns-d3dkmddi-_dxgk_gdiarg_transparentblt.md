# _DXGK_GDIARG_TRANSPARENTBLT structure


## -description


The DXGK_GDIARG_TRANSPARENTBLT structure describes the characteristics of a GDI hardware-accelerated bit-block transfer (bitblt) operation with transparency.


## -struct-fields




### -field SrcRect

[in] A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-tagrect">RECT</a> structure that defines the rectangular area to be copied. This rectangle is specified in the coordinate system of the source surface and is defined by two points: upper left and lower right. The two points that define the rectangle are always well ordered. 

For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -field DstRect

[in] A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-tagrect">RECT</a> structure that defines the rectangular area to be modified. This rectangle is specified in the coordinate system of the destination surface and is defined by two points: upper left and lower right. The rectangle is lower-right exclusive; that is, its lower and right edges are not a part of the bit-block transfer. The two points that define the rectangle are always well ordered. 

The destination rectangle defined by <b>DstRect</b> can exceed the bounds of the destination surface, but sub-rectangles cannot. Additionally, all sub-rectangles are guaranteed to fit inside the destination surface. Sub-rectangles can be constrained further by a bounding rectangle that is smaller than the destination rectangle. 

For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -field SrcAllocationIndex


      [in] An index of the element in the allocation list that specifies the allocation that is referenced by the <b>SrcRect</b> source rectangle.
     


### -field DstAllocationIndex


      [in] An index of the element in the allocation list that specifies the allocation that is referenced by the <b>DstRect</b> destination rectangle.
     


### -field Color


      [in] Specifies the physical transparent color in the source surface, in 32-bit ARGB unsigned pixel format (as defined by the D3DDDIFMT_A8R8G8B8 value of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dukmdt/ne-d3dukmdt-_d3dddiformat">D3DDDIFORMAT</a> enumeration). Any pixels on the source surface that match the transparent color that is specified by <b>Color</b> are not copied.
     


### -field NumSubRects


      [in] The number of sub-rectangles in the destination surface space that is bounded by the <b>DstRect</b> destination rectangle.
     


### -field pSubRects


      [in] A pointer to the sub-rectangles in the destination surface space.
     


### -field Flags


      [in] A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_d3dkm_transparentbltflags">D3DKM_TRANSPARENTBLTFLAGS</a> structure that specifies the display adapter's hardware-accelerated transparent bit-block transfer capabilities.
     


### -field SrcPitch


      [in] The pitch of the source surface, in bytes.
     


## -remarks



The rectangles that are specified by the <b>SrcRect</b> and <b>DstRect</b> members bound all sub-rectangles in the source and destination surface spaces, respectively. The Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem will never request a transparent bit-block transfer if the source and destination rectangles overlap on the same surface.

To complete the transparent bit-block transfer operation, the color of each pixel in <b>DstRect</b> should be computed by using the following formula:

```cpp
typedef DXGK_GDIARG_TRANSPARENTBLT tblt;
if (tblt.Flags.HonorAlpha)
{
  if (SourceColor != tblt.Color)
 {
  DestinationColor = SourceColor; 
 }
}
else
{
 if ((SourceColor & 0x00FFFFFF) != tblt.Color)
 {
  DestinationColor = SourceColor; 
 }
}
```

In this case, a value of 0x00FFFFFF in ARGB format indicates alpha = 0, hence alpha-blending is not implemented.

If a stretch bit-block transfer operation is required, the x and y stretch ratios are computed respectively as the ratios of the x and y sizes of <b>DstRect</b> and <b>SrcRect</b>. Additionally, the stretch operation will proceed as if the COLORONCOLOR value in <i>Wingdi.h</i> is set. In a shrinking bit-block transfer, enough pixels should be ignored so that pixels do not need to be combined. In a stretching bit-block transfer, pixels should be replicated.

For more information about transparent bit-block transfers, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/copying-bitmaps">Copying Bitmaps</a>.

When sub-rectangles are transformed to the source surface space, the result is guaranteed to be within the source surface. The transformation of a sub-rectangle's coordinates in the destination surface to coordinates  in the source surface is defined by the following formulas, where

<ul>
<li>(Xd, Yd) is a point inside the sub-rectangle</li>
<li>(Xs, Ys) is a point inside the source rectangle</li>
</ul>

```cpp
float Ws = SrcRect.right - SrcRect.left;
float Wd = DstRect.right - DstRect.left;
int Xs = round((Xd - DstRect.left + 0.5) * Ws/Wd + SrcRect.left - 0.5)
OR
int Xs = truncate((Xd - DstRect.left + 0.5) * Ws/Wd + SrcRect.left)

float Hs = SrcRect.bottom - SrcRect.top;
float Hd = DstRect.bottom - DstRect.top;
int Ys = round((Yd - DstRect.top + 0.5) * Hs/Hd + SrcRect.top - 0.5)
OR
int Ys = truncate((Yd - DstRect.top + 0.5) * Hs/Hd + SrcRect.top)
```
