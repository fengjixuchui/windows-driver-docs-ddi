# _DXGKARGCB_SIGNALEVENT structure

## -description

Arguments used in the call to [DXGKCB_SIGNALEVENT](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_signalevent.md). 

## -struct-fields

### -field hDxgkProcess

Handle to the DXG process object, which is passed to [DxgkDdiCreateProcess](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createprocess.md). The process must be created for a virtual machine, where DXGK_CREATEPROCESSFLAGS::VirtualMachineProcess is set in DxgkDdiCreateProcess.

The driver must synchronize the callback with [DxgkDdiDestroyProcess](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_destroyprocess.md) to ensure that the process is not destroyed during the callback.

### -field hEvent

User mode event handle, which needs to be signaled. The handle is valid in the context of the DXG process, identified by *hDxgkProcess*. The user mode driver in the guest could send the user mode event handle to kernel mode driver via [DXGKDDI_ESCAPE](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_escape.md) or other APIs, which allow private driver data.

### -field Reserved

Reserved. Should be zero.

### -field Flags
 
The driver must call the callback with the *LastUse* flag during process or device cleanup.

## -remarks

## -see-also
