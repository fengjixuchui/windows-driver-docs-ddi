# _DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST structure


## -description

The <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> structure describes an allocation specification that is used in direct memory access (DMA) buffering.

## -struct-fields

### -field hDeviceSpecificAllocation

[in/out] An open handle to the allocation that is being referenced (that is, the handle that the driver returned in the <b>hDeviceSpecificAllocation</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_openallocationinfo">DXGK_OPENALLOCATIONINFO</a> structure for the allocation in a call to the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_openallocationinfo">DxgkDdiOpenAllocation</a> function).

The following members are embedded in the structure:

#### WriteOperation

[in/out] A member in the structure that <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> contains that can hold information about whether the allocation can be written to. Setting this member to 1 indicates that the allocation can be written to anywhere in the DMA buffer.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of a 32-bit value (0x00000001). 

#### SegmentId

[in/out] A member in the structure that <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> contains that can hold information about the identifier of a segment that the allocation was last paged in at. Setting this member to 0 indicates that no pre-patching information is available.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second through sixth bit of a 32-bit value (0x0000002E). 


#### Reserved

[in] A member in the structure that <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> contains that is reserved. This member should be set to 0.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the remaining 26 bits (0xFFFFFFC0) of a 32-bit value to zeros. 

The following members are embedded in a union:

#### PhysicalAddress

[in/out] A <b>PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> data type (which is defined as <b>LARGE_INTEGER</b>) that indicates the physical address, within the segment that <b>SegmentId</b> specifies, where the allocation was last paged-in at. This member is set to zero if no pre-patching information is available.

Supported starting with Windows 10.

#### VirtualAddress

[in/out] A <b>D3DGPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS</b> data type that indicates the virtual address.

Supported starting with Windows 10.

### -field PhysicalAddress

[in/out] A <b>PHYSICAL_ADDRESS</b> data type (which is defined as <b>LARGE_INTEGER</b>) that indicates the physical address, within the segment that <b>SegmentId</b> specifies, where the allocation was last paged-in at. This member is set to zero if no pre-patching information is available.

## -remarks

In the display miniport driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_render">DxgkDdiRender</a> function, the driver generates a list of <b>DXGK_ALLOCATIONLIST</b> structures for allocation specifications that will be used in a direct memory access (DMA) buffer. The video memory manager uses the list to split and patch DMA buffers appropriately.
