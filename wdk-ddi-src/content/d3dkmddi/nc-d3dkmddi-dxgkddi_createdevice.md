# DXGKDDI_CREATEDEVICE callback function

## -description

The <i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> function creates a graphics context device that is subsequently used in calls to the display miniport driver's device-specific functions.

## -parameters

### -param hAdapter

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.

### -param pCreateDevice

[in/out] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createdevice">DXGKARG_CREATEDEVICE</a> structure that describes the graphics context device.

## -returns

<i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|STATUS_SUCCESS|DxgkDdiCreateDevice successfully created the graphics context device.|
|STATUS_NO_MEMORY|DxgkDdiCreateDevice could not allocate memory that was required for it to complete.|

## -remarks

The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> function to create a graphics context device that the graphics subsystem subsequently passes in calls to the display miniport driver. The driver uses a device to hold a collection of rendering state. The graphics subsystem can create multiple devices in the same process on a given graphics processing unit (GPU) adapter. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The number of devices that can simultaneously exist is limited only by available system memory. That is, a driver cannot have a hard-coded maximum device limit.</div>
<div> </div>
Generally, devices are independent of each other; in other words, resources that are created in one device cannot be referenced or accessed by resources that are created in another device. However, cross-process resources are an exception to this rule. 

<i>DxgkDdiCreateDevice</i> should be made pageable.
