# _DXGK_PRESENTATIONCAPS structure


## -description


The DXGK_PRESENTATIONCAPS structure identifies presentation capabilities of a display miniport driver that the driver provides through a call to its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo">DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field NoScreenToScreenBlt

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver can perform a bit-block transfer (bitblt) from the primary surface to the same primary surface. If <b>NoScreenToScreenBlt</b> is set, the driver cannot perform a screen-to-screen bit-block transfer. Therefore, the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>) will not request the driver to perform such a bit-block transfer.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the first bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000001).


### -field NoOverlapScreenBlt

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver can perform a bit-block transfer that overlaps. If <b>NoOverlapScreenBlt</b> is set, the driver cannot perform a bit-block transfer that overlaps. Therefore, the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem will not request the driver to perform such a bit-block transfer.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the second bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000002).


### -field SupportKernelModeCommandBuffer

 [in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver supports GDI hardware-accelerated command buffer processing. If <b>SupportKernelModeCommandBuffer</b> is set, the driver can perform various hardware-accelerated bit-block transfer (bitblt) and fill operations when the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem calls the display miniport driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_renderkm">DxgkDdiRenderKm</a> function.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    A display miniport driver should report that it supports GDI hardware acceleration only if the cache-coherent GPU aperture segment exists and there is no significant performance penalty when the CPU accesses the memory.</div>
<div> </div>
Setting this member is equivalent to setting the third bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000004). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field NoSameBitmapAlphaBlend

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver can perform an alpha-blending operation when the source and destination allocations are the same. If <b>NoSameBitmapAlphaBlend</b> is set, the driver cannot perform such an operation and the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem will not request it.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000008). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field NoSameBitmapStretchBlt

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver can perform a stretch bit-block transfer operation when the source and destination allocations are the same. If <b>NoSameBitmapStretchBlt</b> is set, the driver cannot perform such an operation and the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem will not request it.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fifth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000010). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field NoSameBitmapTransparentBlt

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver can perform a transparent bit-block transfer operation when the source and destination allocations are the same. If <b>NoSameBitmapStretchBlt</b> is set, the driver cannot perform such an operation and the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem will not request it.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the sixth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000020). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field NoSameBitmapOverlappedAlphaBlend

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver can perform an alpha-blending operation when the source and destination allocations are the same and source and destination rectangles overlap. If <b>NoSameBitmapOverlappedAlphaBlend</b> is set, the driver cannot perform such an operation and the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem will not request it.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the seventh bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000040). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field NoSameBitmapOverlappedStretchBlt

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver can perform a stretch bit-block transfer operation when the source and destination allocations are the same and source and destination rectangles overlap. If <b>NoSameBitmapOverlappedStretchBlt</b> is set, the driver cannot perform such an operation and the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem will not request it.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the eight bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000080). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field DriverSupportsCddDwmInterop

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver supports Canonical Display Driver (CDD) present operations to texture allocations that are created by the user-mode driver for the Desktop Windows Manager (DWM) to use. If <b>DriverSupportsCddDwmInterop</b> is set, the display miniport driver supports such present operations.

If the display miniport driver supports GDI hardware acceleration, <b>DriverSupportsCddDwmInterop</b> is ignored. In this case the driver must support present CDD operations to DWM texture allocations that are created by the user-mode driver.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the ninth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000100). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.

### -field AlignmentShift

[in] A UINT value that specifies the minimum alignment value, in bytes, that the <b>XxxPitch</b> members of the DXGK_GDIARG_XXX structures require. <b>AlignmentShift</b> is given as a binary exponent. For example, to specify a required alignment value of 16 bytes, the display miniport driver should set <b>AlignmentShift</b> = 4. The minimum value is <b>AlignmentShift</b> = 2, which specifies a 4-byte alignment.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the eleventh bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000400). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field MaxTextureWidthShift

[in] A UINT value that specifies the maximum texture width that the display miniport driver supports, which is computed as:

maximum supported texture width = 2 ^ (<b>MaxTextureWidthShift</b> + 11) texels.

For example, if <b>MaxTextureWidthShift</b> = 0, the maximum supported texture width is 2 ^ 11 = 2048.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the twelfth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000800). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field MaxTextureHeightShift

[in] A UINT value that specifies the maximum texture height that the display miniport driver supports, which is computed as:

maximum supported texture height = 2 ^ (<b>MaxTextureHeightShift</b> + 11) texels.

For example, if <b>MaxTextureHeightShift</b> = 0, the maximum supported texture height is 2 ^ 11 = 2048.

Setting this member is equivalent to setting the fifteenth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00004000). 

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field SupportMonoStretchBltModes

Supported starting with Windows 7.


### -field StagingRectStartPitchAligned

[in] A UINT value that specifies whether the display miniport driver requires the starting point (upper-left point) in the rectangle on a CPU-visible staging surface to be pitch-aligned, which means that the left coordinate is 0. If <b>AlignmentShift</b> is set, the upper-left point of the rectangle is pitch-aligned.
