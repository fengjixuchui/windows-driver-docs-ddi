# _DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE enumeration


## -description


Enumeration that describes what caused a glitch during a SetTimingsFromVidPn call.


## -enum-fields




### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_DRIVER_ERROR

Indicates that an internal driver error caused a glitch.  


### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_TIMING_CHANGE

Indicates that the timing requested necessitated a glitch.  This cause should only be used if the OS requested a change which would always result in a glitch rather than something which could have been avoided under other circumstances.  

For example, this should not be used if the driver switches to a different display pipe to support an additional path, but it should be used if the OS requests a different timing to the previous one.  


### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_PIPELINE_CHANGE

Indicates that reconfiguring the display pipeline caused a glitch.  


### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_MEMORY_TIMING

Indicates that changing graphics memory timings caused a glitch.  


### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_ENCODER_RECONFIG

Indicates that changing the configuration of the encoder for a target caused a glitch.  


### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_MODIFIED_WIRE_USAGE

Indicates that modifying the format of pixel data in the transport stream caused a glitch.  


### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_METADATA_CHANGE

Indicates that changing the frame metadata caused a glitch.


### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_NONE

Indicates that there was no glitch.


### -field UINT8
