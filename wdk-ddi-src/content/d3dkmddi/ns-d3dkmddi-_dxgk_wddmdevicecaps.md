# _DXGK_WDDMDEVICECAPS structure

## -description

Contains the WDDM capabilities that was returned from the KMD, in response to the [DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo](../d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md) request for a [DXGK_QUERYADAPTERINFOTYPE](../d3dkmddi/ne-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_queryadapterinfotype.md) value of type **DXGKQAITYPE_WDDMDEVICECAPS**.

These capabilities are queried by the OS during device initialization after [DxgkDdiAddDevice](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md) returns, and before [DxgkDdiStartDevice](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device.md) is called.

## -struct-fields

### -field WDDMVersion
 
The capabilities of a display miniport driver that the driver provides through a call to its DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo function. This value is the same as the **WDDMVersion** value in [DXGK_DRIVERCAPS](../d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_drivercaps.md) structure.
