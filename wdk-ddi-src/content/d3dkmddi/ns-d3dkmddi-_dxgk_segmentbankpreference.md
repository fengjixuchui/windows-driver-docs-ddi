# _DXGK_SEGMENTBANKPREFERENCE structure


## -description


The <b>DXGK_SEGMENTBANKPREFERENCE</b> structure describes bank preferences for paging in an allocation.


## -struct-fields




### -field Bank0

[out] The identifier of the highest priority preferred bank, or 0 if no preference is required. Valid values are from 1 to 127.

This member is equivalent to the first 7 bits of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x0000007F). 


### -field Direction0

[out] The direction in which <b>Bank0</b> should be scanned to locate a free area of memory. A value of 0 indicates a bottom-up search (that is, low address to high address), and a value of 1 indicates a top-bottom search (that is, high address to low address).

This member is equivalent to the eighth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00000080). 


### -field Bank1

[out] The identifier of the next highest priority preferred bank, or 0 if no preference is required. Valid values are from 1 to 127.

This member is equivalent to bits 9 through 15 of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00007F00). 


### -field Direction1

[out] The direction in which <b>Bank1</b> should be scanned to locate a free hole of memory. A value of 0 indicates a bottom-up search (that is, low address to high address), and a value of 1 indicates a top-bottom search (that is, high address to low address).

This member is equivalent to the sixteenth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00008000). 


### -field Bank2

[out] The identifier of the next highest priority preferred bank, or 0 if no preference is required. Valid values are from 1 to 127.

This member is equivalent to bits 17 through 23 of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x007F0000). 


### -field Direction2

[out] The direction in which <b>Bank2</b> should be scanned to locate a free hole of memory. A value of 0 indicates a bottom-up search (that is, low address to high address), and a value of 1 indicates a top-bottom search (that is, high address to low address).

This member is equivalent to the twenty-fourth bit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x00800000). 


### -field Bank3

[out] The identifier of the next highest priority preferred bank, or 0 if no preference is required. Valid values are from 1 to 127.

This member is equivalent to bits 25 through 31 of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x7F000000). 


### -field Direction3

[out] The direction in which <b>Bank3</b> should be scanned to locate a free hole of memory. A value of 0 indicates a bottom-up search (that is, low address to high address), and a value of 1 indicates a top-bottom search (that is, high address to low address).

This member is equivalent to the thirty-secondbit of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member (0x80000000). 


### -field Value

[out] A member in the union that DXGK_SEGMENTBANKPREFERENCE contains that can hold a 32-bit value that identifies bank preferences.


## -remarks



The display miniport driver can indicate up to four bank preferences in the <b>HintedBank</b> member of a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo">DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO</a> structure when the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation">DxgkDdiCreateAllocation</a> function is called. Preferred-bank identifiers are one-based (that is, the first bank has an identifier of one). An identifier of zero indicates that the driver has no preference. The highest priority preference is specified in the <b>Bank0</b> member; the lowest priority preference is specified in the <b>Bank3</b> member. The driver can specify less than four preferences by setting the lower priority preferences of bank identifiers to zero. For example, the driver can specify two preferences by setting <b>Bank0</b> and <b>Bank1</b> to valid identifiers and <b>Bank2</b> and <b>Bank3</b> to zero. The driver can use each <b>Direction</b><i>X</i> member to specify the scanning direction for each bank preference independently. 

 The video memory manager  allocates resources from  preferred segments that the <b>PreferredSegment</b> member of DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO specifies.
