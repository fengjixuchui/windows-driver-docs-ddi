# DXGKDDI_QUERYCURRENTFENCE callback function


## -description


The <i>DxgkDdiQueryCurrentFence</i> function queries about the latest completed submission fence identifier in the hardware command execution unit.


## -parameters




### -param hAdapter

[in] A handle to a context block that is associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem in the <i>MiniportDeviceContext</i> output parameter of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device">DxgkDdiAddDevice</a> function.


### -param pCurrentFence

[in/out] A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_querycurrentfence">DXGKARG_QUERYCURRENTFENCE</a> structure that contains information about the current fence data. 


## -returns



<i>DxgkDdiQueryCurrentFence</i> returns STATUS_SUCCESS, or an appropriate error result if the fence data is not successfully retrieved.




## -remarks



A <i>fence</i> is an instruction that contains 64 bits of data and an address. The display miniport driver can insert a fence in the direct memory access (DMA) stream that is sent to the graphics processing unit (GPU). When the GPU reads the fence, the GPU writes the fence data at the specified fence address. However, before the GPU can write the fence data to memory, it must ensure that all of the pixels from the primitives that precede the fence instruction are retired and properly written to memory. 

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The GPU is not required to stall the entire pipeline while it waits for the last pixel from the primitives that precede the fence instruction to retire; the GPU can instead run the primitives that follow the fence instruction. </div>
<div> </div>
Hardware that supports per-GPU-context virtual address space must support the following types of fences:

<ul>
<li>
<i>Regular fences </i>are fences that can be inserted in a DMA buffer that is created in user mode. Because the content of a DMA buffer from user mode is not trusted, fences within such a DMA buffer must refer to a virtual address in the GPU context address space and not to a physical address. Access to such a virtual address is bound by the same memory validation mechanism as any other virtual address that the GPU accesses.

</li>
<li>
<i>Privileged fences</i> are fences that can be inserted only in a DMA buffer that is created (and only accessible) in kernel mode. Fences within such a DMA buffer refer to a physical address in memory. 

Note that if the fence target address was accessible in user mode, malicious software could perform a graphics operation over the memory location for the fence and therefore override the content of what the kernel expected to receive.

</li>
</ul>
Note that a privileged DMA buffer can contain both regular and privileged fences. However, if a privileged DMA buffer contains a regular fence, the kernel component that generated such a DMA buffer is aware that the regular fence inside might never be accessible.

If the display miniport driver missed the last fence of a DMA buffer, the driver's <i>DxgkDdiQueryCurrentFence</i> function might be called to report the missed fence. For example, if the hardware generates a fence to memory, the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_interrupt_routine">DxgkDdiInterruptRoutine</a> function is triggered to read the memory. However, if the fence's data is not available when the driver attempts to read the data (for example, if there is a defective chipset), the fence is typically reported at the next interrupt, unless interrupts were stopped. If interrupts were stopped and the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem waits too long for a fence, the subsystem calls the driver's <i>DxgkDdiQueryCurrentFence</i> function to verify the current fence and determine any pending fence that it might have missed.

Before the display miniport driver returns from a call to <i>DxgkDdiQueryCurrentFence</i>, if the latest hardware-completed submission fence identifier has not yet been reported, the driver must call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_notify_interrupt">DxgkCbNotifyInterrupt</a> function to report the fence. To implement this functionality, the driver:

<ol>
<li>
Tracks which fence was last reported to the operating system.

</li>
<li>
Raises IRQL to device interrupt. To raise IRQL to interrupt level, the driver can call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkcb_synchronize_execution">DxgkCbSynchronizeExecution</a> function to synchronize with its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_interrupt_routine">DxgkDdiInterruptRoutine</a> function.

</li>
<li>
At device interrupt IRQL, compares the last reported fence with the latest hardware-completed fence.

</li>
<li>
At device interrupt IRQL, calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_notify_interrupt">DxgkCbNotifyInterrupt</a> only when the latest hardware completed fence is newer than the last reported fence.

</li>
</ol>
<i>DxgkDdiQueryCurrentFence</i> should be made pageable.
