# _DXGK_PREEMPTCOMMANDFLAGS structure


## -description


The DXGK_PREEMPTCOMMANDFLAGS structure specifies a union that contains either a structure with a reserved member or a 32-bit value. No bit-field flags are currently defined.


## -struct-fields




### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero. Setting this member to zero is equivalent to setting all 32 bits (0xFFFFFFFF) of the 32-bit <b>Value</b> member to zeros.


### -field Value

A member in the union that DXGK_PREEMPTCOMMANDFLAGS contains that can hold a 32-bit value.
