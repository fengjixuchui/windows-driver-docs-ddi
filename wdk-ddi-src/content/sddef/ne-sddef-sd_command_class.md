# SD_COMMAND_CLASS enumeration


## -description


The SD_COMMAND_CLASS enumeration lists the classes of Secure Digital (SD) card commands.


## -enum-fields




### -field SDCC_STANDARD

Indicates an SD card command from the standard command set. This command set includes command codes 0 to 63.


### -field SDCC_APP_CMD

Indicates an SD command from the application command set. This command set includes command codes 0 to 63, preceded by the application command escape code 55.

SD card drivers should not issue CMD55 (APP_CMD) commands through the SD bus interface. The bus driver will automatically issue the CMD55 command on behalf of the SD card driver when the command class is SDCC_APP_CMD.
