# IOCTL_POINT_OF_SERVICE_GET_PROPERTY IOCTL


## -description

This I/O control function returns the value of the specified property from the device driver.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

Pointer to a buffer that contains the [PosPropertyId](./ne-pointofservicedriverinterface-_pospropertyid.md) for the property you want to get.

### -input-buffer-length

Size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by *lpInBuffer*. Set to sizeof(*PosPropertyId*).

### -output-buffer

Pointer to a buffer that receives the property value.

### -output-buffer-length

Size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by *lpOutBuffer*.

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

Returns **TRUE** if successful; otherwise, returns **FALSE**.

## -remarks

To get extended error information, call [GetLastError](/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror). The following list shows common error values (other status values may be returned as defined by your GET property callback implementation):

- STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED: The calling thread does not have a claim on the device.

- STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW: The output buffer is not large enough to contain the output value. The driver will copy as much data into the output buffer as possible.
