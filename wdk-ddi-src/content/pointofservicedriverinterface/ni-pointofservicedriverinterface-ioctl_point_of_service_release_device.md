# IOCTL_POINT_OF_SERVICE_RELEASE_DEVICE IOCTL


## -description

This I/O control function is called when a client is ready to relinquish its claim on a device.

## -ioctlparameters

### -input-buffer

Not used with this operation; set to **NULL**.

### -input-buffer-length

Not used with this operation; set to **0** (zero).

### -output-buffer

Not used with this operation; set to **NULL**.

### -output-buffer-length

Not used with this operation; set to **0** (zero).

### -in-out-buffer

### -inout-buffer-length

### -status-block

Returns **TRUE** if successful; otherwise, returns **FALSE**.

## -remarks

To get extended error information, call [GetLastError](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror). The following list shows common error values:

- STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED: The device is currently claimed by another client.

- STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY: The POS library has not been successfully initialized.

The driver can handle this IOCTL by calling [PosCxReleaseDevice](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/poscx/nf-poscx-poscxreleasedevice).

To use this IOCTL, the client must have previously called [IOCTL_POINT_OF_SERVICE_CLAIM_DEVICE](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/pointofservicedriverinterface/ni-pointofservicedriverinterface-ioctl_point_of_service_claim_device).
