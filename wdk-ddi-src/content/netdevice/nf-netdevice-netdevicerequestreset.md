## -description

The **NetDeviceRequestReset** function triggers the NetAdapterCx framework to perform the platform-level device reset operation that recovers an unresponsive NIC device.

## -parameters

### -param Device

[in] The WDFDEVICE object the client driver previously created with a call to [**WdfDeviceCreate**](../wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md).

## -remarks

A client driver calls **NetDeviceRequestReset** when it detects device failure. **NetDeviceRequestReset** returns immediately to the client driver. The driver can only call **NetDeviceRequestReset** at PASSIVE_LEVEL.

**NetDeviceRequestReset** is nonblocking and returns immediately to the client driver. The client driver should cancel any ongoing jobs that access the currently failed device.

We recommend that client drivers set up a [**NET_DEVICE_RESET_DIAGNOSTICS_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netdevice-net_device_reset_diagnostics_capabilities.md) structure to collect meaningful reset diagnostics during the device reset and recovery process.
For more on how to collect reset diagnostics, see [Register the optional diagnostics collection callback](/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/platform-level-device-reset/#register-the-optional-diagnostics-collection-callback).
