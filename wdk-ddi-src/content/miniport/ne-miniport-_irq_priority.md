# _IRQ_PRIORITY enumeration


## -description


The <b>IRQ_PRIORITY</b> enumeration type indicates the priority the system should give to servicing a device's interrupts.


## -enum-fields




### -field IrqPriorityUndefined

Specifies that the device does not require any particular priority for its interrupts.


### -field IrqPriorityLow

Specifies that the device's interrupts are of low priority. This setting is appropiate for devices that can tolerate higher-than-normal latency.


### -field IrqPriorityNormal

Specifies that the device's interrupts are of normal priority. 


### -field IrqPriorityHigh

Specifies that the device's interrupts are of high priority. This setting is appropriate for devices that require low latency. 


## -remarks



The system uses <b>IRQ_PRIORITY</b> to assign IRQLs for devices. For example, it might assign a higher IRQL to a device that has an <b>IRQ_PRIORITY</b> of <b>IrqPriorityHigh</b> than it does to a device that has an <b>IRQ_PRIORITY</b> of <b>IrqPriorityLow</b>.
