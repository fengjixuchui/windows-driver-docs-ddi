## -description

The <b>WRITE_PORT_BUFFER_USHORT</b> routine writes a number of USHORT values from a buffer to the specified port address.

## -parameters

### -param Port 

[in]
Pointer to the port, which must be a mapped memory range in I/O space.

### -param Buffer 

[in]
Pointer to a buffer from which an array of USHORT values is to be written.

### -param Count 

[in]
Specifies the number of USHORT values to be written to the port.

## -remarks

The size of the buffer must be large enough to contain at least the specified number of USHORT values.

Callers of <b>WRITE_PORT_BUFFER_USHORT</b> can be running at any IRQL, assuming the <i>Buffer</i> is resident and the <i>Port</i> is resident, mapped device memory.
