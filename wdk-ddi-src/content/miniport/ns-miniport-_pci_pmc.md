# _PCI_PMC structure


## -description


The PCI_PMC structure is used to report the contents of the power management capabilities register.


## -syntax


```cpp
typedef struct _PCI_PMC {
  UCHAR              Version  :3;
  UCHAR              PMEClock  :1;
  UCHAR              Rsvd1  :1;
  UCHAR              DeviceSpecificInitialization  :1;
  UCHAR              Rsvd2  :2;
  struct _PM_SUPPORT {
    UCHAR Rsvd2  :1;
    UCHAR D1  :1;
    UCHAR D2  :1;
    UCHAR PMED0  :1;
    UCHAR PMED1  :1;
    UCHAR PMED2  :1;
    UCHAR PMED3Hot  :1;
    UCHAR PMED3Cold  :1;
  } Support;
} PCI_PMC, *PPCI_PMC;
```


## -struct-fields




### -field Version

Contains a 3-bit integer that indicates the version of the <i>PCI Power Management Interface Specification </i>that the device complies with. For a list of values that can be assigned to this member, see the <i>PCI Local Bus Specification</i>.


### -field PMEClock

Indicates, when 1, that the device relies on the presence of the PCI clock for operation of the PME signal. When this member is a "0", no PCI clock is required to generate the PME signal.


### -field Rsvd1

Reserved.


### -field DeviceSpecificInitialization

Indicates when 1 that the device requires a special initialization. For more information about this value, see the <i>PCI Local Bus Specification</i>.


### -field Rsvd2

Reserved.


### -field Support



#### Rsvd2

Reserved.



#### D1

Reserved.



#### D2

Reserved.



#### PMED0

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D0.



#### PMED1

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D1.



#### PMED2

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D2.



#### PMED3Hot

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D3.



#### PMED3Cold

Indicates that the device can assert the PME signal from D3.


### -field _PM_SUPPORT






## -remarks



The power management capabilities register, whose contents are reported in the PCI_PMC structure, provides information about the power management capabilities of the device.
