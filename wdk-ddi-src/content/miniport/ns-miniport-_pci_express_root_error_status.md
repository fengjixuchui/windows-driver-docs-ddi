# _PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS structure (miniport.h)


## -description

The PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS structure describes a PCI Express (PCIe) root error status register of a PCIe advanced error reporting capability structure.

## -struct-fields

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME

### -field AsULONG

A ULONG representation of the contents of the PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS structure.


#### - AdvancedErrorInterruptMessageNumber

The MSI/MSI-X vector that is used for the interrupt messages that are generated in association with any of the status bits of the advanced error reporting capability.


#### - CorrectableErrorReceived

A single bit that indicates that a correctable error message has been received.


#### - FatalErrorMessagesReceived

A single bit that indicates that one or more non-fatal uncorrectable error messages have been received.


#### - FirstUncorrectableFatal

A single bit that indicates that the first uncorrectable error message that was received was for a fatal error.


#### - MultipleCorrectableErrorsReceived

A single bit that indicates that multiple correctable error messages have been received.


#### - MultipleUncorrectableErrorsReceived

A single bit that indicates that multiple uncorrectable error messages have been received.


#### - NonFatalErrorMessagesReceived

A single bit that indicates that one or more non-fatal uncorrectable error messages have been received.


#### - Reserved

Reserved.


#### - UncorrectableErrorReceived

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable error message has been received.

## -syntax

```cpp
typedef union _PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS {
  struct {
    ULONG CorrectableErrorReceived  :1;
    ULONG MultipleCorrectableErrorsReceived  :1;
    ULONG UncorrectableErrorReceived  :1;
    ULONG MultipleUncorrectableErrorsReceived  :1;
    ULONG FirstUncorrectableFatal  :1;
    ULONG NonFatalErrorMessagesReceived  :1;
    ULONG FatalErrorMessagesReceived  :1;
    ULONG Reserved  :20;
    ULONG AdvancedErrorInterruptMessageNumber  :5;
  };
  ULONG Â AsULONG;
} PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS, *PPCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS;
```

## -remarks

The PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS structure is available in Windows Server 2008 and later versions of Windows.

A PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS structure is contained in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_pci_express_rootport_aer_capability">PCI_EXPRESS_ROOTPORT_AER_CAPABILITY</a> structure.
