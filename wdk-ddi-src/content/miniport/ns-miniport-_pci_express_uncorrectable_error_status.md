## -struct-fields




### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME




### -field AsULONG

A ULONG representation of the contents of the PCI_EXPRESS_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR_STATUS structure.


#### - CompleterAbort

A single bit that indicates that a completer abort has occurred.


#### - CompletionTimeout

A single bit that indicates that a completion timeout has occurred.


#### - DataLinkProtocolError

A single bit that indicates that a data link protocol error has occurred.


#### - ECRCError

A single bit that indicates that an end-to-end cyclic redundancy check (ECRC) error has occurred.


#### - FlowControlProtocolError

A single bit that indicates that a flow control protocol error has occurred.


#### - MalformedTLP

A single bit that indicates that a malformed transaction layer packet (TLP) has been detected.


#### - PoisonedTLP

A single bit that indicates that a poisoned transaction layer packet (TLP) has been detected.


#### - ReceiverOverflow

A single bit that indicates that the receiver has overflowed.


#### - Reserved1

Reserved.


#### - Reserved2

Reserved.


#### - Reserved3

Reserved.


#### - SurpriseDownError

A single bit that indicates that a surprise down error has occurred.


#### - Undefined

A single bit that contains an undefined value. In versions of the <i>PCIe Specification</i> prior to version 1.1, this bit indicates that a link training error has occurred.


#### - UnexpectedCompletion

A single bit that indicates that an unexpected completion has occurred.


#### - UnsupportedRequestError

A single bit that indicates that an unsupported request error has occurred.
