# _INTERFACE structure (miniport.h)


## -description

The <b>INTERFACE</b> structure describes an interface that is exported by a driver for use by other drivers.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

Size, in bytes, of a structure defining a driver interface, including this structure and interface-specific members.

### -field Version

Driver-defined interface version.

### -field Context

Pointer to interface-specific context information.

### -field InterfaceReference

Pointer to a driver-supplied <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-pinterface_reference">InterfaceReference</a> routine that increments the interface's reference count.

### -field InterfaceDereference

Pointer to a driver-supplied <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-pinterface_dereference">InterfaceDereference</a> routine that decrements the interface's reference count.

## -remarks

The <b>INTERFACE</b> structure must be included as the first member of all structures that describe interfaces returned by drivers in response to an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-query-interface">IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE</a> request.

The <i>InterfaceReference</i> routine must be called by the driver that exports the interface, each time the driver supplies that interface in response to <b>IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE</b>. Likewise, if the driver that requests the interface subsequently passes it to another driver, the driver that passes the interface must call <i>InterfaceReference</i> on behalf of the driver that receives it.

Each driver that imports the interface (whether by sending <b>IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE</b> or by receiving the interface from another driver) must call the <i>InterfaceDereference</i> routine after it has finished using the interface. After calling the <i>InterfaceDereference</i> routine, a driver cannot use the interface again without first reobtaining it.
