# _SETRESULT_INFO structure


## -description


The SETRESULT_INFO structure is used as an input parameter to an application's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/compstui/nc-compstui-pfnpropsheetui">PFNPROPSHEETUI</a>-typed callback function. 


## -struct-fields




### -field cbSize

CPSUI-supplied size, in bytes, of the SETRESULT_INFO structure.


### -field wReserved

Reserved.


### -field hSetResult

CPSUI-supplied handle to an added property sheet page, obtained from the application. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


### -field Result

CPSUI-supplied handle to an added property sheet page, obtained from the application. For more information, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks



When an application calls CPSUI's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/compstui/nc-compstui-pfncompropsheet">ComPropSheet</a> function, specifying a function code of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ff547087(v=vs.85)">CPSFUNC_SET_RESULT</a>, CPSUI calls all registered <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/compstui/nc-compstui-pfnpropsheetui">PFNPROPSHEETUI</a>-typed functions, specifying a reason of PROPSHEETUI_REASON_SET_RESULT. When specifying this reason, CPSUI also supplies a SETRESULT_INFO structure.

The values contained in the structure's <b>hSetResult</b> and <b>Result</b> members are the <i>lParam1</i> and <i>lParam2</i> values, respectively, that were supplied to CPSUI's <b>ComPropSheet</b> function.

Each of the application's PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed functions is called in order, from the one most recently declared to the first one declared, until one of these functions provides a return value of less than one. At that point, CPSUI returns from its <b>ComPropSheet</b> function, providing a count of the number of PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed functions that were called.

Typically, an application's PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed function sets the <b>Result</b> member of its PROPSHEETUI_INFO structure to the value received in the SETRESULT_INFO structure's <b>Result</b> member. Then the function returns a value of 1 (or greater), so the next PFNPROPSHEETUI-typed function can also receive it. Each subsequently called function is associated with a page that is the parent of the page associated with the last-called function. A function can modify the contents of SETRESULT_INFO structure's <b>Result</b> member, causing the functions associated with parent pages to receive the new value.
