# UcmUcsiConnectorCollectionCreate function


## -description
Creates a connector collection object with UcmUcsiCx.

## -parameters

### -param WdfDevice [in]
A handle to a framework device object that the client driver received in the previous call to [**WdfDeviceCreate**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate).

### -param Attributes  [in]
A pointer to a caller-supplied [WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes) structure that contains attributes for the new connector collection object. This parameter is optional and can be WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES.

### -param ConnectorCollection [out]
A pointer to a location that receives a handle to the new connector collection object.

## -returns
Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method can return an appropriate [NTSTATUS](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values) value.

## -remarks
The collection object is required for creating a Platform Policy Manager (PPM) object. The client driver creates the object by calling [**UcmUcsiPpmCreate**](nf-ucmucsippm-ucmucsippmcreate.md). The driver must not call [**UcmUcsiConnectorCollectionCreate**] after **UcmUcsiPpmCreate** because it would have no effect on the already existing PPM object.

The connector collection object is parented to the WDFOBJECT even when UcmUcsiConnectorCollectionCreate is called by passing WDF_NO_ATTRIBUTES. The lifetime of the object is manager by the framework.
