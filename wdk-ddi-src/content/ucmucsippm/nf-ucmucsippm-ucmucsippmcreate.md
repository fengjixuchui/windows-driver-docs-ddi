# UcmUcsiPpmCreate function


## -description

Creates a Platform Policy Manager (PPM) object.

## -parameters

### -param WdfDevice [in]
A handle to a framework device object that the client driver received in the previous call to [**WdfDeviceCreate**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate).

### -param Config [in]
A pointer to a caller-supplied [**UCMUCSI_PPM_CONFIG**](ns-ucmucsippm-_ucmucsi_ppm_config.md) structure that is initialized by calling [**UCMUCSI_PPM_CONFIG_INIT**](nf-ucmucsippm-ucmucsi_ppm_config_init.md). The **ConnectorCollectionHandle** member must be set to the handle retrieved in a previous call to [**UcmUcsiConnectorCollectionCreate**](nf-ucmucsippm-ucmucsiconnectorcollectioncreate.md).

### -param Attributes [in]
A pointer to a caller-supplied [WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes) structure that contains attributes for the new connector collection object. This parameter is optional and can be WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES.

### -param PPMObject [out]
A pointer to a location that receives a handle to the new PPM object.

## -returns
Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method can return an appropriate [NTSTATUS](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values) value.

## -remarks
The client driver is expected to call **UcmUcsiPpmCreate** from the [EVT_WDF_DEVICE_PREPARE_HARDWARE](../wdfdevice/nc-wdfdevice-evt_wdf_device_prepare_hardware.md) callback function. 

The structure passed in _Config_ contains Type-C connector information that is necessary for creating connectors with USB Type-C connector class extension (UcmCx) by using [**UcmConnectorCreate**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ucmmanager/nf-ucmmanager-ucmconnectorcreate) and are not obtainable from PPM through UCSI commands such as GetCapability or GetConnectorCapability.

The _Config_ structure also contains connector IDs, which are required for one-to-one mapping between USB Type-C connectors and USB ports.  

The PPM object is also a WDFOBJECT and creates a one-to-one association with the WDFDEVICE handle provided by the client driver.  

The PPM object is parented to the WDFOBJECT even when UcmUcsiPpmCreate is called by passing WDF_NO_ATTRIBUTES. The lifetime of the object is manager by the framework.
