# UcmUcsiPpmNotification function


## -description

Informs the UcmUcsiCx class extension about a UCSI notification.

## -parameters

### -param PpmObject [in]
A handle to a Platform Policy Manager (PPM) object that the client driver received in the previous call to [**UcmUcsiPpmCreate**](nf-ucmucsippm-ucmucsippmcreate.md).

### -param DataBlock [in]
A pointer to a [**UCSI_DATA_BLOCK**] structure that contains information about the USCI notification.

## -remarks
The client driver calls UcmUcsiPpmNotification in the event of a UCSI notification. The driver must not call more than one instance of this function at the same time to avoid a race condition.  

The client driver should assume that the driver can receive a request before this call returns. Hence, if it keeps a lock around this function and the same lock around handling a request, it will result into a deadlock.
