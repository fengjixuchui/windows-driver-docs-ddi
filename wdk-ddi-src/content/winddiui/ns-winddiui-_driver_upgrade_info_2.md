# _DRIVER_UPGRADE_INFO_2 structure


## -description


The DRIVER_UPGRADE_INFO_2 structure is used as an input to a printer interface DLL's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/winddiui/nf-winddiui-drvupgradeprinter">DrvUpgradePrinter</a> function.


## -struct-fields




### -field pPrinterName

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies the name of the printer. For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -field pOldDriverDirectory

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies the local directory in which the old printer driver files can be found.


### -field cVersion

Specifies the operating system version for which the driver was written.

### -field pName

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies the name of the driver (for example, "QMS 810"). For more information, see the Remarks section.


### -field pEnvironment

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies the environment for which the driver was written (for example, "Windows NT x86" or "Windows Itanium").


### -field pDriverPath

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies a file name or full path and file name for the file that contains the device driver (for example, "pscript.dll").


### -field pDataFile

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies a file name or a full path and file name for the file that contains driver data (for example, "qms810.ppd").


### -field pConfigFile

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies a file name or a full path and file name for the device driver's configuration dynamic-link library (for example, "pscrptui.dll"). 


### -field pHelpFile

Pointer to a null-terminated string that specifies a file name or a full path and file name for the device driver's help file.


### -field pDependentFiles

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies the files the driver depends on. Each file name in the string is also terminated with a null character (for example, "pscript.dll\0qms810.ppd\0pscrptui.dll\0pscrptui.hlp\0pstest.txt\0\0").


### -field pMonitorName

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies a language monitor (for example, "PJL monitor"). This member can be <b>NULL</b> and should be specified as non-<b>NULL</b> only for printers capable of bidirectional communication.


### -field pDefaultDataType

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies the default data type of the print job (for example, "EMF"). 


### -field pszzPreviousNames

Pointer to a NULL-terminated string that specifies any previous printer driver names that are compatible with this driver (for example, "OldName1\0OldName2\0\0").


## -remarks



When DrvUpgradePrinter is called with its <i>pDriverUpgradeInfo</i> parameter pointing to a DRIVER_UPGRADE_INFO_2 structure, the <b>pPrinterName</b> member points to a string containing the name of the printer to be updated. The <b>pName</b> member points to a string containing the name of the printer driver to be updated, which is not necessarily the driver for the printer whose name is pointed to by the <b>pPrinterName</b> member. 

To see how this can occur, suppose that a computer is connected to two printers, one whose driver is named "Acme Plotter" and the other whose driver is named "Acme RasterMaster". Suppose also that both drivers share a common driver file, plotui.dll. When the "Acme Plotter" driver is updated by a call to the <b>AddPrinterDriverEx</b> function (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation), DrvUpgradePrinter is called for both printers, because both drivers use files affected by the upgrade. In both calls, the <b>pName</b> member points to "Acme Plotter", the name of the printer driver used in the call to <b>AddPrinterDriverEx</b>. The string pointed to by the <b>pPrinterName</b> member is different in both calls to DrvUpgradePrinter, however. In each call, <b>pPrinterName</b> points to the name of the printer being updated.
