# IOCTL_VOLUME_ONLINE IOCTL


## -description



The <b>IOCTL_VOLUME_ONLINE</b> IOCTL puts the volume in an ONLINE state, which is a state where read and write operations will be executed. The requests are passed down to the physical disk until a subsequent <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddvol/ni-ntddvol-ioctl_volume_offline">IOCTL_VOLUME_OFFLINE</a> is received.

A common use for <b>IOCTL_VOLUME_ONLINE</b> is a case in which the mount manager automatically puts a new volume in the ONLINE state when the volume arrives, unless that volume is listed in a registry key that is populated by the cluster service. <b>IOCTL_VOLUME_ONLINE</b> is called for removable drives regardless of the NoAutoMount setting in the following registry key:

HKCU\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Mountmgr\NoAutoMount

But for volumes controlled by NoAutoMount, assigning a drive letter will cause <b>IOCTL_VOLUME_ONLINE</b> to be called.

For volumes that are controlled by the cluster service, <b>IOCTL_VOLUME_ONLINE</b> is sent by the cluster service when the local node owns the volume. The cluster service uses both <b>IOCTL_VOLUME_ONLINE</b> and <b>IOCTL_VOLUME_ONLINE</b> to allow I/O to a disk volume when the disk volume is owned by the local server. Until the cluster service puts the disk volume in an ONLINE state, no I/O is permitted to the disk volume. This prevents disk volume corruption that could result from multiple cluster nodes writing to the same disk volume simultaneously.
