# PROTOCOL_CM_CLOSE_AF callback function


## -description


The 
  <i>ProtocolCmCloseAf</i> function is a required function that releases per-open resources for an address
  family that a call manager supports.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  You must declare the function by using the <b>PROTOCOL_CM_CLOSE_AF</b> type.
   For more information, see the following Examples section.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param CallMgrAfContext [in]

Specifies the handle to the call manager's per-AF context area, originally supplied to NDIS by the
     call manager's 
     <i>ProtocolCmOpenAf</i> function.


## -returns



<i>ProtocolCmCloseAf</i> returns the status of its operation(s) as one of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that the call manager has successfully released or deactivated any resources that is
       allocated on behalf of the connection-oriented client that opened this instance of the address
       family.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_PENDING</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
Indicates that the request to close the open instance of the address family will be completed
       asynchronously. The call manager must call 
       <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndiscmcloseaddressfamilycomplete">
       NdisCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</a> when all such operations have been completed.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 




## -remarks



<i>ProtocolCmCloseAf</i> releases and/or deactivates any resources that were allocated by the call manager
    in its 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nc-ndis-protocol_cm_open_af">ProtocolCmOpenAf</a> function. The call
    manager also should undo any other actions it took on behalf of the connection-oriented client when the
    address family was opened by that client.

If there are any outstanding requests or connections still open on an address family stored in the 
    <i>CallMgrAfContext</i>, a call manager can respond to a client's request to close the address family in
    either of the following ways:

<ul>
<li>
The call manager can fail the request with NDIS_STATUS_NOT_ACCEPTED.

</li>
<li>
The call manager can return NDIS_STATUS_PENDING. After the client has closed all calls and
      deregistered all SAPs, the call manager can then close the address family and call 
      <b>NdisCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</b> or 
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcmcloseaddressfamilycomplete">
      NdisMCmCloseAddressFamilyComplete</a> to notify the client. This is the preferred response.

</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Examples"></a><a id="examples"></a><a id="EXAMPLES"></a>Examples</h3>
To define a <i>ProtocolCmCloseAf</i> function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of function you're defining. Windows provides a set of function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the function types helps <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/code-analysis-for-drivers">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a <i>ProtocolCmCloseAf</i> function that is named "MyCmCloseAf", use the <b>PROTOCOL_CM_CLOSE_AF</b> type as shown in this code example:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>PROTOCOL_CM_CLOSE_AF MyCmCloseAf;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
Then, implement your function as follows:

<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>_Use_decl_annotations_
NDIS_STATUS
 MyCmCloseAf(
    NDIS_HANDLE  CallMgrAfContext
    )
  {...}</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
The <b>PROTOCOL_CM_CLOSE_AF</b> function type is defined in the Ndis.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition.  The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>PROTOCOL_CM_CLOSE_AF</b> function type in the header file are used.  For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/declaring-functions-by-using-function-role-types-for-ndis-drivers">Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for NDIS Drivers</a>.

For information about  _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=286697">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
