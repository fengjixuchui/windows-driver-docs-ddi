# NdisMCompleteDmaTransfer macro


## -description


The 
  <b>NdisMCompleteDmaTransfer</b> function indicates that a system DMA transfer operation has completed. It
  resets the system DMA controller in preparation for further DMA transfers.


## -parameters




### -param _S

A pointer to a caller-supplied variable in which this function returns the final status of the DMA
     transfer, which can be one of the following:

#### NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS

The data has been transferred and flushed to host memory or to the device to maintain data
       integrity.


#### NDIS_STATUS_RESOURCES

The DMA controller was released but the data transfer might be incoherent.


### -param _H

The handle returned when the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_initialize">MiniportInitializeEx</a> function
     called the 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismregisterdmachannel">
     NdisMRegisterDmaChannel</a> function.


### -param _B

A pointer to the buffer descriptor previously passed to 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismsetupdmatransfer">NdisMSetupDmaTransfer</a>.


### -param _O

The byte offset at which the transfer began. This value also was passed to 
     <b>NdisMSetupDmaTransfer</b>.


### -param _L

The length in bytes of the transfer. This value also was passed to 
     <b>NdisMSetupDmaTransfer</b>.


### -param _M_

<b>TRUE</b> if the transfer was from the host to the NIC, as, for example, a send operation.

## -remarks



<b>NdisMCompleteDmaTransfer</b> must be called with 
    <i>WriteToDevice</i> set to <b>TRUE</b> before the transferred data is considered present in the NIC's memory. 
    <b>NdisMCompleteDmaTransfer</b> must be called with 
    <i>WriteToDevice</i> set to <b>FALSE</b> before the transferred data can be read from host memory.
