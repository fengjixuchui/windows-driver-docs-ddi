# NdisMRemoveMiniport function


## -description


The
  <b>NdisMRemoveMiniport</b> function removes the specified miniport driver adapter that the miniport driver
  has determined is unrecoverable from the system.


## -parameters




### -param MiniportHandle

The handle to the initialized miniport adapter that the miniport driver has determined is
     unrecoverable.


## -returns



<b>NdisMRemoveMiniport</b> can return either of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The miniport adapter has been removed.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_FAILURE</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
An attempt to remove the miniport adapter failed.

</td>
</tr>
</table>
Â 




## -remarks



If a miniport driver has determined that a particular miniport adapter has failed and is
    unrecoverable, the miniport driver can call 
    <b>NdisMRemoveMiniport</b> to remove the miniport adapter from the local computer system. In this call,
    the miniport driver passes the handle to the miniport adapter to remove.

For example, if a miniport driver detects that a miniport adapter is resetting very frequently and is
    causing the computer to freeze every few seconds, the driver can request NDIS to remove the miniport
    adapter.
