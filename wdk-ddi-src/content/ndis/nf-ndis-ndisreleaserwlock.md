# NdisReleaseRWLock function


## -description


The 
  <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b> function releases a read/write lock that the caller uses to gain access to
  resources that are shared between driver threads.


## -parameters




### -param Lock [in]

A pointer to an opaque 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff567279(v=vs.85)">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> variable that represents a
     lock. The caller can use this lock to gain write or read access to resources that are shared between
     non-ISR driver threads.


### -param LockState [in]

A pointer to an opaque 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/ns-ndis-_lock_state_ex">LOCK_STATE_EX</a> variable that tracks the state
     of the lock. This variable exists in the interval between the times that the caller obtains and releases
     the lock. The caller must use a different variable of type LOCK_STATE_EX for each attempt that it makes
     to obtain the lock from the same non-ISR driver thread.


## -returns



None




## -remarks



NDIS drivers call the 
    <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b> function to release a read/write lock that was previously obtained by calling the    
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockread">NdisAcquireRWLockRead</a> or 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockwrite">
    NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</a> function.

A driver must obtain a read/write lock before the driver can call 
    <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b>. Each call to obtain a lock requires a reciprocal call to 
    <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b>.

The acquisition of an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff567279(v=vs.85)">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> is affinitized to the current processor.  Drivers must call <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b> on the same processor that made the corresponding call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockread">NdisAcquireRWLockRead</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockwrite">NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</a>.

<b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b> restores the original IRQL that was used by its caller before the lock was
    obtained.
