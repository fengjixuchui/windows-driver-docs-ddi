# NdisMCmDeleteVc function


## -description

<b>NdisMCmDeleteVc</b> destroys a caller-created VC.

## -parameters

### -param NdisVcHandle 

[in]
Specifies the handle identifying the VC to be deleted. The caller originally obtained this handle
     from 
     <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcmcreatevc">NdisMCmCreateVc</a>.

## -returns

<b>NdisMCmDeleteVc</b> can return one of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Return code</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
NDIS deleted the VC.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<dl>
<dt><b>NDIS_STATUS_NOT_ACCEPTED</b></dt>
</dl>
</td>
<td width="60%">
The VC is still active, so it could not be deleted.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## -remarks

When an MCM driver calls 
    <b>NdisMCmDeleteVc</b>, there must be no outstanding calls on the given VC and that VC must have been
    deactivated. To meet these requirements implies that the MCM driver has already called 
    <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcmdeactivatevc">NdisMCmDeactivateVc</a> with the given 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> successfully.

Only the driver that created a particular VC can delete that VC. A call to 
    <b>NdisMCmDeleteVc</b> causes NDIS to call the 
    <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-protocol_co_delete_vc">ProtocolCoDeleteVc</a> function of the
    client with which the caller shares the 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> .

When 
    <b>NdisMCmDeleteVc</b> returns control, the 
    <i>NdisVcHandle</i> is no longer valid. The MCM driver can release the resources it allocated to maintain
    state about the deleted VC or prepare them for reuse in a subsequent incoming-call notification after it
    calls 
    <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcmcreatevc">NdisMCmCreateVc</a>.

The driver writer determines whether an MCM driver has an (internal) 
    <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_co_delete_vc">MiniportCoDeleteVc</a> function that the
    driver calls in the context of tearing down connections for outgoing and incoming calls.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmDeleteVc</b>. Stand-alone call managers and clients, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCoDeleteVc</b> instead.
