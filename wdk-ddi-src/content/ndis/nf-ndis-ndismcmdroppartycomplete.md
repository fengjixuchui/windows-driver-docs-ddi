# NdisMCmDropPartyComplete macro


## -description


<b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the MCM driver
  previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to remove a party from a multipoint VC.


## -parameters




### -param _S_

Specifies the final status of the requested operation, either NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS or any
     caller-determined NDIS_STATUS_
     <i>XXX</i> except NDIS_STATUS_PENDING.

### -param _H_

Specifies the handle to the party that the client requested be dropped. The MCM driver obtained
     this handle from its per-party state area designated by 
     <i>CallMgrPartyContext</i> that was passed as an input parameter to its 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nc-ndis-protocol_cm_drop_party">
     ProtocolCmDropParty</a> function.

## -remarks



An MCM driver must call 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> if its 
    <i>ProtocolCmDropParty</i> function previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING for the given 
    <i>NdisPartyHandle</i> . Neither NDIS nor the client, which initiated the pended drop-party operation with
    a call to 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndiscldropparty">NdisClDropParty</a>, can release the
    resources they allocated to maintain per-party state until the MCM driver's call to 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> causes a call to that client's 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nc-ndis-protocol_cl_drop_party_complete">
    ProtocolClDropPartyComplete</a> function.

If it passes NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS for the 
    <i>Status</i>, the MCM driver must consider the 
    <i>NdisPartyHandle</i> invalid when 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> returns control. The MCM driver can release (or reinitialize for reuse)
    any resources that it allocated to maintain state for this party after 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b> returns control.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmDropPartyComplete</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmDropPartyComplete</b> instead.
