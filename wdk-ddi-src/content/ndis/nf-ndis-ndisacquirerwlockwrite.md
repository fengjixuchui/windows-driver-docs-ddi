# NdisAcquireRWLockWrite function


## -description


The 
  <b>NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</b> function obtains a write lock that the caller uses for write access to
  resources that are shared between driver threads.


## -parameters




### -param Lock [in]

A pointer to an opaque 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff567279(v=vs.85)">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> variable that represents a
     lock. The caller can use this lock to gain write or read access to resources that are shared between
     non-ISR driver threads.


### -param LockState [out]

A pointer to an opaque 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/ns-ndis-_lock_state_ex">LOCK_STATE_EX</a> variable that tracks the state
     of the lock. This variable exists in the interval between the times that the caller obtains and releases
     the lock. The caller must use a different variable of type <b>LOCK_STATE_EX</b> for each attempt that it makes to
     obtain the lock from the same non-ISR driver thread.


### -param Flags [in]

A <b>ULONG</b> value that contains lock flags. Set this parameter to <b>NDIS_RWL_AT_DISPATCH_LEVEL</b> if the
     caller's current IRQL is <b>DISPATCH_LEVEL</b>. Otherwise, set this parameter to zero. For more information
     about dispatch IRQL tracking, see 
     <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/dispatch-irql-tracking">Dispatch IRQL Tracking</a>.

<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  If the caller knows the current IRQL is <b>DISPATCH_LEVEL</b>, set this parameter to <b>NDIS_RWL_AT_DISPATCH_LEVEL</b>.  This flag makes the lock even more efficient by causing it to omit a check for the current IRQL.  If the current IRQL is unknown, do not test the current IRQL with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-kegetcurrentirql">KeGetCurrentIrql</a> solely to determine whether to set this flag, as it is more efficient to allow the <b>NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</b> function to test the IRQL itself.</div>
<div> </div>

## -returns



None




## -remarks



NDIS drivers call the 
    <b>NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</b> function to modify resources that are shared between driver threads.

The driver must allocate a variable of type 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff567279(v=vs.85)">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> with the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisallocaterwlock">NdisAllocateRWLock</a> function before the
    driver calls the 
    <b>NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</b> function. The driver must provide a handle to 
    <b>NdisAllocateRWLock</b> for the resident storage for the locks it uses.

After the driver calls 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisallocaterwlock">NdisAllocateRWLock</a>, it can call 
    <b>NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</b> or 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockread">NdisAcquireRWLockRead</a> to obtain
    either write or read access to the resource. Only one non-ISR driver thread at a time can obtain write
    access to the resource. When one non-ISR thread has write access, all read and write accesses by other
    non-ISR threads must wait until the write-access holder releases the lock. However, if a non-ISR thread
    has read access, other non-ISR threads can concurrently obtain read access.

The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff567279(v=vs.85)">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> lock does not support promotion from read to write.  Once a processor has acquired an <b>NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</b> for read access (by calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisacquirerwlockread">NdisAcquireRWLockRead</a>), the same processor must not attempt to acquire write access (by calling <b>NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</b>) until the previous read access is released.

An <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff567279(v=vs.85)">NDIS_RW_LOCK_EX</a> write lock  can be acquired recursively on the same processor.  For each call to <b>NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</b>, there must be a corresponding call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisreleaserwlock">NdisReleaseRWLock</a>.  The lock is only released after the last call to <b>NdisReleaseRWLock</b>.

A driver thread should never hold a write lock for more than a few microseconds. Holding a write lock
    for a prolonged period of time degrades both operating system and driver performance.

The driver cannot use a lock to protect resources from read or write access that its other functions
    share with the 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_isr">MiniportInterrupt</a> or 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_disable_interrupt">
    MiniportDisableInterruptEx</a> functions, or both. Instead, the driver must call 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismsynchronizewithinterruptex">
    NdisMSynchronizeWithInterruptEx</a> so that its 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ndis/nc-ndis-miniport_synchronize_interrupt">
    MiniportSynchronizeInterrupt</a> function accesses such shared resources at the same DIRQL that its 
    <i>MiniportInterrupt</i> or 
    <i>
    MiniportDisableInterruptEx</i> functions, or both, do.

<b>NdisAcquireRWLockWrite</b> raises the IRQL to <b>DISPATCH_LEVEL</b> by obtaining a spin lock.
