# IOCTL_HID_DEVICERESET_NOTIFICATION IOCTL


## -description


The <b>IOCTL_HID_DEVICERESET_NOTIFICATION</b> 
   request is sent by the HID client driver to HID class driver to wait for a device-initiated reset event. This request can also be sent by the HID Class driver to the HID Minidriver to wait for a device-initiated reset event.

Only one device reset notification request is allowed at any one  time.

A HID minidriver can enable this feature by adding a registry value in the INF file. The <b>DeviceResetNotificationEnabled</b> under the device's hardware key must be set to 1 to enable the feature. Here is an example:

<code>[hidi2c_Device.NT.HW]
AddReg = hidi2c_Device.Filter.AddReg, hidi2c_Device.Configuration.AddReg
</code>

...






<code>[hidi2c_Device.Configuration.AddReg]</code>

...


<code>HKR,,"DeviceResetNotificationEnabled",0x00010001,1
</code>
