### -field PrintJobStatus_Error

### -field PrintJobStatus_PaperOut

### -field PrintJobStatus_Deleted

### -field PrintJobStatus_Restarted

### -field PrintJobStatus_Complete

The job data transfer to the printer is complete. Note that  the printing of the job may not yet be complete.


### -field PrintJobStatus_Retained

The job has been retained in the print queue and cannot be deleted.


## -remarks



A <b>PrintJobStatus_Retained</b> flag can be raised for several reasons. For example, jobs could be kept in the queue if the administrator of the queue used the desktop print queue UI to set the “Keep Printed Jobs” feature to be on.

It is possible for a job to have multiple  flag values specified simultaneously.
