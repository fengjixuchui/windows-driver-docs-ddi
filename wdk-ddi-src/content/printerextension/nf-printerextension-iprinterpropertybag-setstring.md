# IPrinterPropertyBag::SetString


## -description


Writes a string property.


## -parameters




### -param bstrName [in]

The property to set.


### -param bstrValue [in]

The property value to set.


## -returns



This method returns an <b>HRESULT</b> value.




## -remarks



In Windows 8.1 a new flag, PRINTER_ACCESS_MANAGE_LIMITED, has been introduced to grant print queue permissions that are more limited than PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER, but more powerful than 
PRINTER_ACCESS_USE.

The permissions are a subset of those associated with PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER. This means that if the currently logged-on user has PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER permission, the user can gain 
PRINTER_ACCESS_MANAGE_LIMITED access to the queue.

A call to set a property on a queue property bag will fail with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED, if the user does not have the appropriate permission. This behavior was true before PRINTER_ACCESS_MANAGE_LIMITED was introduced, and it's still the current behavior.
