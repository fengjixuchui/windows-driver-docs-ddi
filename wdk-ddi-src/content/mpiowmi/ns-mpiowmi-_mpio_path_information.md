## -struct-fields




### -field NumberPaths

An unsigned 32-bitfield that represents the total number of paths that MPIO is aware of.


### -field Pad

Should be zero.


### -field PathList

An array that returns information about each of the paths. The number of elements in the array is given by <i>NumberPaths</i> and each element of the array represents an instance of an MPIO_ADAPTER_INFORMATION structure.
