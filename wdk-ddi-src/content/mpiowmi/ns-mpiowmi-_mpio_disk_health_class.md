# _MPIO_DISK_HEALTH_CLASS structure


## -description


The MPIO_DISK_HEALTH_CLASS structure contains the health information for a multi-path disk.


## -struct-fields




### -field Name

The name of this multi-path disk.


### -field NumberReads

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the number of read requests that are serviced by this multi-path disk.


### -field NumberWrites

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the number of write requests that are serviced by this multi-path disk.


### -field NumberBytesRead

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the total number of bytes that are read from this multi-path disk.


### -field NumberBytesWritten

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the total number of bytes that are written to this multi-path disk.


### -field NumberRetries

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the total number of retries for this multi-path disk.


### -field NumberIoErrors

An unsigned 64-bitfield that specifies the total number of I/O errors that are encountered by this multi-path disk.


### -field CreateTime

A 64-bit integer that specifies the system time when the health packet was created for this multi-path disk.


### -field PathFailures

A 64-bit integer that specifies the total number of path failures for this multi-path disk.


### -field FailTime

A 64-bit integer that specifies the system time when this multi-path disk went offline or failed.


### -field DeviceOffline

A Boolean field that indicates whether the multi-path disk is offline or has failed.


### -field NumberReadsWrap

An unsigned character field that specifies the total number of times that the <i>NumberReads</i> parameter has rolled around to zero.


### -field NumberWritesWrap

An unsigned character field that specifies the total number of times the <i>NumberWrites</i> parameter has rolled around to zero.


### -field NumberBytesReadWrap

An unsigned character field that specifies the total number of times that the <i>NumberBytesRead</i> parameter has rolled around to zero.


### -field NumberBytesWrittenWrap

An unsigned character field that specifies the total number of times that the <i>NumberBytesWritten</i> parameter has rolled around to zero.


### -field Pad

Should be zero.
