# MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY enumeration


## -description


This enumeration represents the accuracy states of the magnetometer.


## -enum-fields




### -field MagnetometerAccuracy_Unknown

Indicates that the magnetometer's accuracy cannot be determined.


### -field MagnetometerAccuracy_Unreliable

Indicates that the magnetometer readings are unreliable. The application can choose to prompt the user to calibrate the compass, to improve accuracy.


### -field MagnetometerAccuracy_Approximate

Indicates that the magnetometer readings are approximate values.


### -field MagnetometerAccuracy_High

Indicates that the magnetometer accuracy is set to high.
